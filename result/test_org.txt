Hello, I am looking for some movie recommendations.  Do you have any Horror Movies that you could suggest for me?
I do!
bạn đã xem phim này chưa @185171 ?
I have seen @185171  I very much enjoyed this movie.  When I was younger I liked movies like @130591 .
I liked that one too!
I also liked to watch the @77161  Series.
I loved that as well
mainly because Johnny Depp is in it
I love Johnny Depp! So handsome, such a great actor.
I love johnny Depp in @159090 .
Me too
one of my favorites from him is @85082
I am not sure if I have ever seen that movie, I am going to have to check that one out.
It is very creepy and dark but full of suspense
Thinking of Johnny Depp have you ever seen the movie @120349 ?  It is a story By the author Steven King.
I own it! I actually have a poster still on my door from it, it was really good
I love a good Steven King movie
His performance in that movie is phenomenal.
I am a huge fan of Steven King.  His novels help foster my love of reading and story telling.
Well thank you for talking with me.  I think I am ready for my movie night now.
excellent! I hope you enjoy
good bye
good bye.
Hello, I am looking for some movie suggestions.  What would you suggest?
Are you looking for movies currently in theatres?  I like @205430.
I want to have a movie night with friends.  I have not seen @205430 but I think it looks really good.  I do love scary movies.
One of the best scary movies I have seen in recent years is @118338 , have you seen this one?
nếu bạn thích recent scary movies, I might suggest @144779.
I have not seen @118338
@118338 is a good suggestion for me
I have seen @144779  it was very good. I also very much enjoy watching an old movie like @132562 and then watching the remake @158950 .
It is very interesting to see what changes and what does not, to see the difference that all these years makes in the style of the movie.
I enjoyed @173191 but have not seen @158950 hoặc @132562.
How about a recommendation for a comedy.  After all these scary movies we will need something to lighten the mood at the end of the evening.
Maybe something classic like @177915
I like @76279, the original British comedy.
Oh i have never seen that I will have to check it out.  Well I think I am ready for my movie night now.  Thank you so much.
Thanks, enjoy!
Good Bye

1967

Hello, have you seen the new IT movie?
I have! I loved it.
How about the Sixth Sense?
I know it is older but it was good?
I feel like it was so much more intense than  @204794
I agree it was more intense then It(1988)
I think I've seen the @170119  but its been ages ago
What kind of movie are you looking for now?
I just finished seeing @204974  and loved the action. Nhưng I'm all caught up on the marvel movies now.
Might I suggest you go back and watch the movie Sixth Sense since you cannot remember if you saw it?
I think that would be an excellent idea, Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors. Honestly, thinking about it now I'm pretty sure I was thinking of @112346  earlier.
I love Bruce Willis too and can watch the movie over and over.
Right!? I can't tell you how many times I've rewatched @161313  and still enjoy it just a much.
Oh yes, one of my favorites. I hope you enjoy Sixth Sense (1999) even if you have seen it.
Thank you for the recommendation, I'll definitely have to watch it this week!
Great. Good bye my friend.

Hello
Hi! Have you seen a good action movie lately?
nó có been a while since I've seen any action films, though I do like movies like @183121.
I have always loved the idea of having some sort of power like they have.
That is a great title. Loved it, If you have not seen it yet, I highly recommend @148904
I loved @148904 .
It is action packed with great fight scenes.
They do say there is no bond like one between a man and his dog.
I am also like the movie @108746 .  It is suspenseful, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.
I haven't seen @108746
Oh and this other one I think the name is @146872 , it is an intense movie to watch.  Makes you wonder about big brother watching our every move.
That is a great recommendation! I will have to check those out. If you're into shooting movies, you should watch @156094
I'm not sure if I've seen that one hoặc not.  either way I will have to watch it now.
I like all kinds of movies really.  One of my all time favorite movies is @84001 and I have a hard time describing it to people but it is really worth checking out.
I have yet see that one either. I will definitely check it out. Thanks for the great suggestions. I have got to go now. I hope you have a wonderful day
You as well thank you and good bye.
Hello, I hear you are looking for movie recommendations.  Do you have any sort of genre in mind?
Yes, I'd recommend psychological thrillers.  Have you seen @161244?
No I have never seen that one.  I will have to check it out.  Growing up I always like movies like @77161  and @130591 .
As for newer movies I really enjoyed @118338 . It was riveting.
Those are classics.  I'd like to see @77161 hoặc the remake @119295.
I have not seen the remake.
Have you seen @157190?
No I have not seen that one either.  I guess I have a few to look into.  I really liked @125431 though.
I enjoyed @144779 but never did see the original.  I felt like the sequel stood well on its own.
I will have to check out the original!
Well you have a wonderful evening I hope I helped.
You certainly have!  Thanks!
Thank you, good bye.
Goodbye.
Hello! How are you?
Hi I am good
How are you
I'm fine. Do you have any good suggestions for a good movie?
What kinds of movies do you like? Do you like dramatic movies?
I love action and funny movies, so I looking for something that combines the two,
Do you like @84273 ?
You may like @193168 .
I have heard about it, but have never seen it. What is it about?
@84273 is about two slackers that witness a murder. It is hilarious!
You might love @78340 !
That does so really funny. And that would be the perfect movie for today.
That is full of action and comedy.
The @148477 is a class too!
Yes, I highly suggest @84273 !
I have heard so many things about Deadpool and from the ads it looks so good. Thank you. I just might give Deadpool a try.
You won't be disappointed.
That sounds great. I am so glad I could help you find a great movie to watch.
I wonder if you have seen any of the movies I suggested?
Have you see @148477 hoặc @193168 ?
Maybe you have seen @151102 ? That is a good movie too.
I think you need to agree you have seen one I suggested. :)
Hello! How are you?
Hi! Do you have a good movie for me? I like dramas.
I am great.
Do you like classic dramas like Casablanca, hoặc would you prefer something more recent?
I really likeI like @160038 a lot. I love old movies.
I have seen @160038 .
I like @77455 too.
nếu bạn thích @160038 , you might enjoy @156293 hoặc @87541
@119062 is another favorite old movie of mine, though it doesn't have the same hard-boiled feel to it
What is @156293 about? That sounds interesting.
I think I would like to watch @156293 .
In @156293 Humphrey Bogart's character clashes with mobsters in a Florida resort town, and falls in love with Lauren Bacall along the way
Thanks so much for the help! Bye!
Have a good day!

Hello I am looking for some suggestions for an upcoming movie night with firends.
What kinds of movies have you liked before with this group of friends?
When I was younger I loved watching @77161
Do your friends also like scary movies?
And more recently I have enjoyed @118338.
I am not sure of all of their preferences
I was thinking maybe to have a couple different genres.
Would @139205 be a good horror choice?
Oh I have seen that one too.  It was wuite good, surprised by the ending.
Sorry I mean Quite
I would also say @78340 could be a good film for a group of people. Funny and with action involved. Lots of super hero movies right now
I love @78340 and I think you are right that will be a great movie to watch with friends.
What about a comedy?  I always liked @170060 hoặc @157394 .
We are a big fan of @124485 and @99910 in my house. A bit older like the two you mentioned and super funny. I just love Mel Brooks
I have seen and love @124485 but not @99910 though I think I've heard of it.
Well thank you so much I think I can plan my movie night now.
Good luck! I hope your friends enjoy the choices
Thank you, Good Bye.
Hello! What kind of movie are you looking for today?
Hello
I guess I am not sure what I am looking for.  Do you know of any good romance movies?
I love @188302 . Its an older fairy tale romance with Drew Barrmore
@173253 is also a good action adventure romance.
I've never really watched these types of movies and I don't know where to start.
I haven't seen either of these I will have to check them out.
What else would you like in the movie? comedy, fairy tales?
I always like @88267 I think that is the name of it.
What movies outs die of the romance genre do you like?
And not really that romantic but totally hilarious @121440.
I love comedies like @85159.  This movie never fails to crack me up.
So @88267 is a crime movie with some romance
And there is another I don't know what you would call the genre but the name is @84001 .
Have you seen @166069?
Some romance and action
Yes but @88267 the love was so real it strikes me as a great romance,
I have never gotten through all of @166069.
Well I am definitely going to look in to your recommendations.  Thank you, have a great day.
Did you like the scifi aspect of @84001 ?
Have a nice day!
Hello what kind of movies are you looking for?
Hi, I love musicals and am looking for some new ones!
@106887 is a current favorite
I am not sure that I know many musicals.  I have never seen @106887.
I have seen @80240  as a child.
I also enjoy @111694
I have seen Annie but it was sort of meh
I haven't seen that one either.  If anything I am a horror fan all the way.
I grew up watching @77161 and @130591.
I havent seen a lot of horror movies because they terrify me
I like that scared to the couch feeling, though sometimes I have to follow up my horror movies with a great comedy.  Something like @90253.
I love Adam Sandler! My favorite movie of his is @150451
Do you know of any other good 90's comedies?
I love @150451.
@170060  and @86168 are 2 all time favorites.
I havent seen either of those but I will take a look! Thank you for the new movie suggestions
Thank you too.  You have a great day, good bye.
Hi there are you interested in some classic comedies?
I am actually looking for movies for my 12 yr olds sleepover
There is a movie called @177915 and it is absolutely hilarious.
Well @177915 is family friendly I could do better I am sure.  How abut @134885  and @100750
I dont think the kids would be interested in a movie that old. Hunger Games they have seen and love
Well how about @119144 .
They really liked @77610 when I showed that to them and @119144 could be good too
I could also suggest @133236.
I think I will try that with them as well.
or the newest one I believe is @181715 .
We havent seen that one but they do like super heroes
I think that should be enough movies for one sleepover
sounds good.  You have a great day.  Thank you and good bye.
Hello, are you a movie buff?
Hi, I guess I could say yes from the ridiculous stack of movies :) you?
I watch many movies. I especially like science fiction. Any recommendations?
An oldy but a goody is @134101. I prefer more actions and comedies, any recomendations?
I like Bruce Willis action.
I really enjoy movies like @78418 and @99583. Recently we watched @136632 and it was great!
I like Seven Samori as well as the Magnificent Seven.
I like Bruce Willis in a lot of movies, especially in @161313
I will watch The Avengers again, Thanks!
I have not seen @93115
Please watch it. Lots of action. A classic.
I will add it to the Netflix que. Thank you!
I guess we are through, nice talking to you.
Have a great day!
goodbye
Hi! What kind of movies are you looking for today?
I want to watch some classics like @127676.
Or maybe something like @134101.
Have you seen both of those movies?
oh yes I have seen both of them multiple times.
Not as old but @197200 I would consider a semi classic.
I have not seen @197200 hoặc if I have I do not remember it all.  I will have to check that out.
It is comedic
Oh there is another old one that I always loved nó có a little bit of everything it is called @114785.
Along the same lines as Airplane is @87490 which is a lesser known movie I was introduced to in a film class
I have heard of it before but I have never actually watched it.  I will definitely have to check it out now though.
Oh and another all time favorite is @78168.
nếu bạn thíchd @114785 for the music I would suggest @105923
And another good Gene Wilder film is @99910 !
I will have to check those ones out as well.
Thank you for all the suggestions.  this should keep me busy for a while.
Woudl you like any other suggestions?
No I think that's great thank you, Good bye.

Hey I heard you're looking for movies what kind of recommendation would you like?
I enjoy movies with a lot of action.
Have you seen @78340 this movie is action packed to the max.  I can't wait to get to see @204870.
Yes I have seen Deadpool and you are right, its great. I'm also waiting on the second one
Do you like Mark Wahlberg?  He's in a great movie called @108746 , this movie is full of action and suspense.  Edge of my seat the whole time.
Really? Yes I have heard of him but not that movie. I'll have to check it out.
Do you have any other suggestions?
Oh for sure, it is a great movie and Mark Wahlberg is a stud.  bạn đã xem phim này chưa @111063 ?
Missed that one as well.
Oh you gotta into it.  It's a great movie.
I will do that. Did he ever do fantasy type movies? I'm into those as well
I'm not sure, I would have to look into that.  There is one he is in called @192810.  Kind of crazy scary movie.
Sounds interesting. I'll check those out. Thank you.
Thank you, good bye.

Have you seen @118762 ? I thought that was a pretty funny movie
I have seen that movie and it is definitely hilarious.  I have yet to watch the next one though, @133128.
That movie is also pretty good! I would also recommend watching @192120 for romance, it is a very sweet and emotional movie. It is in an animated style.

I haven't seen @138962 yet. I have seen @90253.

I love @90253  and @115155 .
Do you like movies about sports that are more of a drama?
@164311 ?
I don't know if that's considered a sports movie
I have seen and liked @164311 . He's an agent for a football player so I would say so.
Oh I know, @196460 ! @141210 !
@203730 ,
I am a movie recommendation machine.
There are many of them.
My dog has tipped over a can of pop. I must go! Good luck!

@156624 is like those too.

@156624, is that with ryan Reynolds?
The timeline gets pretty jumbled near the end.
Yes!
I love that movie, but I never found someone else who does.
I do. It's great.
Did you see @141614 ?
I was thinking about checking that out.
No, I heard bad review about it though.

Oh great.  Did you see any of the @115463  movies?
Yes I have seen them all except @204419 !
Same here.  I plan on watching @204419 too.  Would it be safe to say you enjoy gore movies?

Hello
Hi, what movies do you like?
I like mind benders and documentaries.
My favorite little known thriller is @77066
Oh, I haven't heard of that.
The new @206020 documentary is good. Ken burns' documentaries are great.
There's a pbs channel with great documentaries.
I watch a lot of Netflix documentaries.
I haven't seen RBG but I'll check into it.
@79968 is like @77066 . Have you seen that?
I believe I saw a trailer fhoặc @79968 sounds familiar but I can't be sure if I've seen it
@101483 , @156624 , and @91025 are great little thrillers.

Yes i think so
What about @204478
I wish there were more movies like @135571 I know they like that one
Oh, @204478 ! That's perfect! Thanks so much. I'm going to check for it at the redbox next time I'm out.

I have not, but I watched a review of it and people hated it, haha
What about @204334 ? hoặc @141614 ?
I have seen @204334 actually, and I loved it. What about something more like a mystery movie?
I've seen @193005 with Ryan Gosling and loved it
@124545 is recommended
Oh yes, that looked good. There's a new Cloverfield movie too @205305 that just came out on Netlfix.

Hello there
Hi. How are you?
You like movies?
I'm doing okay
Getting ready to put in @138962
I havent seen that
I like comedy and action
Me neither, but I saw the preview fhoặc @204455 and I thought it looked funny, so I figured I'd start with @138962 first
have you seen @204870 yet?
I havent seen that yet. I have seen @78340
a good combination of comedy and action, for sure!
One of my favorites is @163398
Yes!
I havent seen that either. What is it about?
Its about a guy who wants to be with this girl, but in order to do so he must fight her 7 exes. And then he meets them and fights them like, pokemon style, hoặc mortal combat style
Its sort of comic book/video game style movie
Wow! Interesting. Seems funny.
Did you like the most recent @100723 ?
It was okay not as good as I thought it would be.
Well thank you for the suggestions! Have a great day! Bye!
You too!

@188779 was a good Will Ferrell movie from last year.
Havent seen that one.
He always has funny movies
@137861 was a low profile, but good movie, too.
What is that one about?
It's with Daniel Radcliffe where he is like a reanimated corpse and he helps a guy stranded on an island. It's wacky.
@204644 with Jennifer Lawrence was good in my opinion.
Yea im not too sure about that one!
Haven't seen that one either
Thank you for all your suggestions, I will definitely check them out thank you!
Have a good one.

I liked @173575, @89173 , and @131869 but not @82923
Plus it doesn't have to be animated
Sure, I'd recommend @205724 and @206021 from this year.

I'd also recommend @122604 and @84854 from last year.
None of those are
I haven't seen @159885 in FOREVER! I'll have to re watch it so that I can be ready fhoặc @205724 to be on dvd

@136983 is a classic, i watched it decades ago. Would definitely enjoy anything similar to it. @169487 i didn't like it, comedy there is vulgar. Haven't seen @174475, bạn có thích nó không?
Yes @174475 is definitely a classic.
@169487 has good social commentary, but I understand it's not for some.
@189705 and @180437 are both from the same era and have a similar feel as @136983
You are right @169487 is not for everyone. I would watch @174475  based on your suggestion. I absolutely loved @180437 , story is phenomenal and great humor throughout the film.

Because i have not heard about those movies
Yes! Very! They are very good but very disturbing.
Can i watch them with my girlfriend?
I wou;dn't reccomend @119840 to watch with your lady... it is pretty explicit and rough
Unless she is tough!

Hahaha, i guess she is not haha
Another very good one is @181960 directed by this wacko Lars Von Trier... it is spooky and gross but very well directed. The photography is beautiful and eerie

Hm, I've never heard of that. I'll check it out
And there is the goofball time travel movie @147314 lol
Oh yeah, I've seen that. Great movie!
Nhưng if you want a VERY serious time travel movie ful of science and brain twists, you could try @129966
It is almost TOO serious but it is really good

Hello! What kind of movies are you looking for today?
Hi! I'm looking for something scary. My favorite is @115463
I'm not super familiar with scary movies. I have a friend who loves them and prefers the classics like @77161 and @86831
Oh yeah, I've seen @77161 and loved it, but not any of the Chucky movies.
I'll have to check out Chucky. What about something like a thriller? I'm a huge fan of @144347
I havent seen Taken but I did enjoy @101264 which is a thriller in sort of a different vein
Oh, that one was good. A lot of odd filming techniques in that.
Can you think of any others?
Thrillers like @101264 I would also suggest @132885 as well.
Very good. I haven't seen Gravity yet. I've been waiting to get a big TV for it.
Thank you for the recommendations. Have a great day!

Have you seen any good ones lately?
@157187 - haven't heard about it. What's the plot?
I'm not 100% sure what @157187 's plot is, just that it's about a mother and has Charlize Theoron

Yeah, @120948 inspired a lot of things in the last 25 years. When you get a chance you should give it a shot. One of the best comedy classics from early 90s. Did you like @204334?
Yeah, I liked @204334 . I wouldn't call it movie of the year hoặc anything, but it was really entertaining.

I saw that it was a okay movie
@205934 was cool
You should watch it great movie

Hi, how are you?
Hello!  I am looking for a cheesy horror movie, something along the lines of @206027 .  Do you know of something?
I really enjoyed the campiness of that movie.
Hmm. Maybe you'd like @87048. Have you heard of it?
Yes, I have.  But, I'm looking for something that is intentionally being funny.  Another example would be @194556
I know that is a difficult genre to fill if you don't watch it, but I like humor and horror together.
Maybe you'd like @182960 hoặc @127508? What do you think?
Oh, yes.  I've seen @182960 but I don't believe I've seen @127508 .  Those are good suggestions.
Well I hope you enjoy! :)
I loved the @77161 series because of the humor mixed in with the horror.  That is another good example of what I am thinking of.
Gotcha! Well check those two out and have a great day!
You, too.
Good morning
how are you
Whats the last movie you seen?
Hi, I haven't seen a new movie in a while but was thinking of revisiting a classic like @190147. Do you like romance films?
I wouldn't be interested in that but thanks
Whats your favorite movie
The @206029 seem like a cool
have you seen it
I have never heard of it! I think my favorite film is @142823. I am a huge Leonardo DiCaprio fan! Have you seen it?
@149543 .. Dont keep up with the new movies thats coming out?
bye
Hi, I am looking for Jim Carrey movies. Can you recommend any good ones?
@190418 is a good one i remember from my childhood.
Same here! I loved it! What's your second favorite?
I also really enjoyed @187778!
@187778 was my next pick
Oh wow okay cool! I see we have similar tastes! Did you like @150501?
I did but it did really feel like a Jim Carrey role.
Hmm. I totally get out! I think the only movie of his I really didn
't enjoy was @89770. Very weird!
Did you enjoy @143259 ?
Yeah @89770 was a very weird one
OH WOW! I have not seen that one! Was it good?
He basically takes a vow to say Yes to everything no matter what for a year
Oh yes I did!! It was very unmemorable... obviously haha
I prefer his early films
Did you ever see @122385?
Yes i did. I cant believe they made a sequel @107420
Me either! What did you think?
First 1 was better. 2 Had its moments.
I feel the same but I would have rather they left it at one!
How about @152497? Did you see that one?
I did! It was okay. Also not one that stands out a lot for me! His earlier stuff was way more unique.
Really loved @166052
I totally agree.
I love @166052.
Well it was really nice chatting with you! I haven't had a chance to talk about Jim Carrey movies with someone who seems to be as big of a fan as I am! :)
I know. I was very nice meeting someone with great taste in movies!
Haha, oh wait! What did you think about @176100??
He was a sad dude in that Movie. I liked it but the stalker vibe kinda made it weird
Yes totally!!!
We are so on the same page!!
I know right.
K! Well I hope you enjoy the rest of your day!
You too!
Thanks!
hello
how are you doing
Whats the last movie you seen?
Fine how are you? The last movie I saw was @184418 and I hated it. What about you? What kind of movies do you like?
I am great
Why didnt you like it
It was very predictable and a little cheesy. Did not like the whole hypnosis aspect. Reminded me a lot of @130589. Have you seen that one?
The last movie was @205934 and @204870 ool have you seen either one?
No I never heard of that one
No I have not! I have heard great things about @204870 though. Have to check it out!
Yes good one
nice talking to you
have a great day
bye
Same here! You too thanks!
Greetings
How are you doing
Hello!  I'm good, I  hope you are well!  I would like to see a comedy.  Something irreverent, perhaps.
Something similar to @122552 maybe.  Definitely something more adult oriented.
That was a good movie
Have you seen any new movies lately
Yes.  I laughed so hard!
@204870
Oh, no, I haven't watched any out at the movie theater recently.
@78418
I haven't seen Deadpool 2.  That is a great suggestion.
okay
Is I haven't seen @204870 , I mean.
I also haven't seen @78418 .  Is it really funny?
Another movie that i thought was hilarious was @90766 .  I like movies that are crazy in a stupid way.
@204870 have its moments of funny and comedy
@78418 was action
I haven't seen that one
Great!  I think we might go see that this weekend.  Thank you for the suggestion.
okay have a great one
bye
You have a great holiday weekend!  Goodbye!
you too
Good morning!  How are you?
Hi, how are you? I'm fine thanks! I am a huge Leonardo Dicaprio fan! Can you recommend any movies?
I'm doing great!  I love Leonardo also.
How about @142823 ?  Did you see that?  It won awards.
YES!! It is my favorite movie actually! I also really enjoyed @141107. Have you seen that?
Also, an oldie but goodie would be @82476 .  I think that movie was severely underrated.  Dicaprio was amazing in that role.
I have seen @141107 .  It was good.
Oh, my ALL TIME FAVORITE Dicaprio movie has to be @111099 .
Oh yeah, those really good as well! I also really loved @194237.
I know most people would say @175096 , but I like @111099 even better.
Awesome movies.
Do you think you have something to see out of that list?
@175096 was AMAZING!
Yes, thanks so much for the recommendations! :) Have a great day!
It was.  We saw it three times at the theater.
You have a great day.  Goodbye!

Of course, if you want something edgy, I really liked @77788
I saw Clerks but did not like it. Not a fan of stoner flicks!
I always loved @178711 .  I remember seeing that when it came out.
Oh, another great comedy is @84798, but it's not purely comedy, I suppose.
Hmm. I liked Meg Ryan in @199453 and I do like Tom Hanks so will definitely give that a try! Thank you very much!!

thanks for the suggestions have a great day
Hello!  How are you?
Hi, how are you? Can you recommend any horror cult classics?
Sure, I love horror films.  I think one that is often overlooked is @193742 .  Some of the dialogue is stiff, but nó có a unique concept and great scares.
Oh that sounds really good! I like good scares! Anything else?
nếu bạn thích something that is creepy, there is @176641 .  I think the original one is the best!
Oh I saw that! You have good taste!
If you are in the mood for something that is more playful, there's always @117333 .  It's a collection of stories so I'm sure there would be something in there you would enjoy.
No I don't like playful. Looking for something intense!
Thank you!  It sounds like you have good taste, too.  Finally, I would suggest @76012 .  Always my go-to when I want to be truly frightened.  I remember seeing the re-release several years back, being the only person in the movie theater because it was in the middle of the week when I was off, and jumping out of my skin several times because it was so freaky.
I really liked that movie though I watched it in the dark when I was young and made it through haha
Thanks a lot!!

Hello
What's your favorite movie?
Hi!
My favorite movie is @109211 !
What is yours?
Oh awesome
bạn nên xem @195447 and @97820
Cool! I haven't seen those yet
Sam Elliot is wonderful
Have you seen @165308 ?
Yes I thought it was great!
Do you have any other suggestions for action movies?
Nope, have a great day though!
Enjoy @195447
Hey, what's up?
Hey. You enjoying the holiday?
I am so far! What about you? Got anything planned?
It's raining here, so I was thinking about going to a movie hoặc going bowling.
Sounds fun. What kind of movie?
Not sure really. Maybe a romantic comedy.
Those are always entertaining. I hear @206022 is pretty good.
@206022? The remake of the Goldie Hawn movie? It's a little too slapstick-ish for me.
I like classic films like @181072
What have you seen lately that's good?
What about @186271 ? It's older so you might have to look around to find it but I enjoyed it.
The most recent movie I've seen was @204870 . It's a bit vulgar and more of an action comedy but I have to say it does have a good message!
I'm kinda over super hero movies. Nhưng I'll check out @186271. Thanks for the tip.
You're welcome! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
And if you're ever looking for another great romantic comedy, I also suggest @121123 .
I loved Bradley Cooper in @147970
If you loved in in that, you'll definitely love him @121123 . His performance is superb. So is his co-star's, Jennifer Lawrence.
Have to run. Thanks again for your suggestions.
You're very welcome! Enjoy the holiday!
Hey, what you up to?
Watching a baseball game, but I would like a good comedy recommendation for when the game ends.
You like old school hoặc new school comedies?
How about a couple from both?
One of my favorites is @111918 with Will Farrell. You seen it?
@111918 is one of my all-time favorites. Very funny movie.
What about @141928
@141928 is also excellent. John C. Reilly and Will Ferrell are a great comedic duo.
John C. Reilly is a genius. Don't know nếu bạn thích musicals, but he was awesome in @145997
I never saw @145997. I should add that to my watchlist.
@205375 will be out in a few weeks. Really want to see that one.
Is @205375 the all female version of that heist series?
Yeah with Sandra Bullock
Good to know. I liked the original and the remakes.
I didn't like @120947 that much. Nhưng I liked the rest of them.
A lot of star power in all of those movies. I think that made all of them watchable. Thank you very much for helping me with movie recommendations.
You're welcome. Enjoy the rest of your weekend.
Hey what's up?
Hi, have you seen @162882 ?
Yeah. You like Tom Hanks?
I do, I loved him in @164755 . Did you see that one?
Yeah, the soccer ball Wilson lol. Did you see him in @140771
I think I did see that. How about him in @78172 ?
I usually love him but I didn't in that. hoặc in @157783. It was awful
I didn't see that. He is the highest paid actor in the world I've heard. So good for him. This is really old but @126305 is good.
One of his best I think. And you should check out @90272
It's got a Beatles vibe.
Sounds good. Are we ready to check out?
Yeah. Have a good night.
Ditto

Oh yes, that is a classic

Have a great night too!
I saw a great movie last week.
Really, what movie was that?
@206029 with Gabrielle Union. It was a lot like @110605 with Jodie Foster
Oh really, I haven't seen either of them? Are they more in the genre of horror hoặc suspense?
Suspense. Both are about mothers protecting kids during a home invasion. Nhưng nothing gory like @151728
I don't do well with gory moves, but I love suspense movies! I may have to check those out!
And consider @184418 if you haven't seen it. It's suspenseful but also comedic.
I love when movies mix comedy and suspense, I will have to add that one to my list as well.
Great. Hope you like them. Have a great night.
You as well. Thank you.

It's a mockumentary about the great rock band of all time
Hilarious stuff
Enjoy! Have a great night
I'll check it out.
Hello!
I loved @204651 . Could you recommend any musicals like it?

Did you hear that Steven Speilberg is doing a remake of @79278
Nope, I never saw that either.
@154716. Bob Fosse was the choreographer
Very old school. How about something newer?
Well I'd recommend staying away from @104180 Very cheesy
Oh haha, it was Oscar worthy
Thanks for those though
Have a great night
you too

Hello
Hi there!
What kind of movies do you like?
I love @85036 , can you recommend something like that?
Have you seen @188165 hoặc @129966 ? Both of those are pretty good.
Oh yes, I loved both of those movies
Can you think of anything else?
There's also @147934. It's a classic!
And @101264 is pretty good too.
Oh very cool, I haven't seen @101264
I'll check that out for sure
Thanks so much, have a great night
Awesome! You have a great night too!
Hello, how are you today?
I am okay. Feeling pretty tired after a long day. Action movies always keep me entertained and upbeat. Know any good ones?
I know a few off top my head. @161313  is a great action movie
That and @194044 are good Bruce Willis Flicks.
I have heard so much about the Die hard franchise but I've never seen all of them
I've seen Looper, it was alright.
If you are in the mood for a good story @117515 is a real kicker.
That movie was amazing. I love the creatures in it. Such an amazingly put together movie.
Any others like that?
Die Hard Franchise was great back in the day. @170059 and @201436 are half decent.
Other's like @117515 that I can think off that is similar would be @193368
hoặc @187310
I agree @117515 was awesome!
Oh boy. Lord of the rings is like something I would avoid. Way too long for me plus I'm not a fan of the books so I'd fall asleep. I would probably only watch for Orlando Bloom.
Thank you for all off the suggestions. I might just check them all out in the end.
Haha! I hear ya. It is a total marathon watch.
Thank you for asking and have a great day!
Have a great evening.
Hey there
What's your favorite movie?
Jurassic Park.
The original. All those sequels are crap
Haha okay
Have you seen @146188 hoặc @189494 ?
I liked @101158 too
Never heard of @146188. @189494  was too violent for me. I didn't like @79062  either.
Oh darn, yeah they get pretty violent
Well, enjoy your recommendation
Have a great night
u-2
Hello!
Hey how are you doing?
I love @85637 , can you recommend action hoặc mob movies?
I'm great
My mother loves Mob movies. Have you seen @141578
Oh yes, the ending was amazing
Definitely!
I know you've had to have seen the classic @196336
Haha, no actually. I never saw that one.
Can you recommend anything else?
How about @147826 . I heard it was very good.
Plus I love anything with Leo in it
Oh yep, love DDl
Oh yep, love DDl
Thanks a bunch
Have a great night
Hello
What's your favorite movie?
Hello
My favorite movie would be @139878
Any movies similar?
I would like to relax with some robot apocalypse-type movies
So relaxing
have any recommendations?
How about @99660 hoặc @117126 ?
I saw both and enjoyed them thoroughly
@177123 was okay too
@117126 that ending really threw me off. I kind of predicted it but was still kinda disappointed
I have never seen @177123
I thought it was a little boring, too much style and not enough substance
It's Bruce Willis actiony, but with a futuristic twist
Yea, i agree.
how about a kids movie to end the night?
any kids movie will do
@135250
Enjoy!
Sweet Thanks for the info
Have a great night and goodbye!
Bye

@124485 is a great comedy! Have you ever seen it?
I have never heard of it
It is especially great because it is a making fun of all the space movies!
It is pretty old, but it is funny!
Okay I will give it a try
What about something recent like @205435
I loved that movie
Well, I am not sure about Game Night. That is really recent. What was the plot?
Pretty much what the titles says. Well what would you suggest thats recent?
Let's see recent comedies...I heard that @83552 is pretty cool
The new one
Okay I saw that one cool movie though
Oh, you already saw it?
Yes indeed

I heard they are all tied together like @108934 and @99583 are on the same team hoặc something
Yes, exactly and they all are a twist on real human adventures
Most are bad science experiments gone wrong.
Nhưng Batman movies like @134106 isn't a part of that?
I like both movies that you mentioned @108934
Then when you bring the @78418 into it I get confused haha.
Okay I'll watch @108934
Haha well luckily if you watch each movie they do really stand alone.
Good to know lol
thank you for your help
DC vs Marvel is such a weird world!
@78418 are all apart of the same world with individual problems with their gifts
That is a good point of view you make.  I did not think to mention the different brands of comics
Do the Avengers hang out with @99583  and those guys?
I'm thinking @184098
!!! LOL im sorry
@184098 is more like @99276
okay I see. Thank you for explaining. Whenever I try to keep up my boyfriend gets so annoyed. I basically have to wiki everything
The stories of the Universe verses galaxy and worlds.  I love them all. They are very entertaining
its good to know they are all separate.
have a good one!
Yes you do the same. Try one of the newer stories like @204870 you may not be able to tie it into other comic stories.  However, you will surely be entertained.
you too.
I loved @78340
Well you are gonna love part 2, hands down!
It is action packed and full of humor.
Thank you! goodbye!
The comic stories also tend to have really good sound tracks.  My favorite is @97820  series and @120281
ok i'll add to my list
You are very welcome! Have a good night and enjoy these movies with your honey.
you are very helpful
I am glad I could assist. Goodbye

Wow so many great movies! Thank you! Which one did you like the most?
I liked @201761 the most
I really liked @134032 . Nhưng I haven't seen @201761 .
you should check it out
have a great day
hi
hello, how are you?
I really like movies like @122552 and @204331
Im fine, ty for asking. What are you favorite movies?
What would you recommend?
good choices
I love stoner movies like @84273 and @111776
I can't wait for the new @160690
i would recommend @122385
I love those movies as well!
OMG! That's one of my favorites too!
I will watch it again tonight!
Thanks!
Have an awesome day !
I may also recommend @199831
Your welcome and goodbye!
Oh cool, I'll check it out.
Goodbye!
Thank you for visiting
Hi. How are you?
Hi, I'm great.
Thanks for asking.
How are you?
What kind of movies do you like?
I am awesome. Thank you. Can you please recommend me a movie to watch with my husband?
I like comedies, dramas, detectives. What about you?
Oh sure.  How about @204870 I just seen it and loved it.  You'd want to also catch @78340  before seeing part two.
Both movies are hilarious and his love interest makes it a little romantic.
Is @78340 a comedy?
I love all the same genres too.
@78340 sounds too sad
I'm sure it could fall under the Comedy category.  And its actually a movie based on a Comic Book series.
He's part of Marvel Universe
And it's packed with comedy.
Oh that's awesome ! I would definitely watch @78340 and @204870 . Any other suggestions?
He's more of an anti-super hero actually so he doesn't always do things the right way.
Thank you for the information! What is your favorite movie?
How about @205435 for a good old comedy
My favorite all time, would be @143198
Yours?

Haha. Have not seen it. Will give it a try!
What about something like @143020?
Something with a more fantasy theme is @168644
Mel Gibson used to be awesome

nếu bạn thích Hugh Jackman in a performance role, you might like @114560 hoặc you might also like @125515 with Colin Hanks.

Thank you I am :) I enjoy action and comedy!!
Know of any good ones ?!
Sure!  If you are into action, I'd recommend seeing @91481 .
Oh yesss that was a great movie !!!
Have you seen @101264
If you want more action than that, you could see @205163
I haven't seen @101264 .  I keep meaning to see it.
Ohh! Is it good?! I heard so many mix reviews
It’s super good!!
Definately have to watch it !!
I liked @166117 .  Also, @134106  is great for edge-of-your-seat action.
I meant to say I liked @205163
Exactly !!! I totally agree! Did you see @204974  I really liked it
I send it 3 times !
Oh, and comedy and action should get you to see @204870
I haven’t seen the first one hoặc second of deadpool
I haven't caught @204974  yet, but plan to very soon at home.
@78340  is not for the kids, but it is funny.
Yess! Definately recommend it !

Hello! How are you
I'm good!  My brother is coming to visit and I want to queue up some good old fashioned monster movies for him.  Any suggestions?
@98259 is pretty good!
It could also be a modern version of an old fashioned monster movie, hoặc something that has them in it.  For example, @180224 is a good example of a modern monster movie.
@120722
Well, @81819  isn't really the type of movie I was looking for.  Isn't that the one with Charleze Theron?
Is really good
Yes !
I haven't seen @120722 .  Is it a monster movie?
Yes it is!
Have you seen @197186
My brother likes @189381  and @119424 , that type of thing.
Oh, @197186  sounds PERFECT.
Yes it’s not super good classic movie !
Thank you for the suggestion!!  It's the kind of thing my brother likes.  He's a nerd.  :)

Oh wow. I haven't even heard of it. Looking it up right now...

Hmmm. I always loved @79136

Thank you for the suggestions!
I didn't really like it, though.

I love the previews on that one.  I would also suggest something older like @90253 .
I think I will definitely have to check that one out.
Oh I love Adam Sandler he is hilarious.
My husband and I love the scene with the alligator food.
Oh yes one of my favorite movies ever.  bạn đã xem phim này chưa @85159 ?
You would like @139333 I bet.

What kind of movies do you like?
I like everything but I am trying to plan a movie night with friends.  Can you suggest anything?
Sure.  Are you going to the theater hoặc staying home and streaming?
We'll be staying in.
Okay.  If you want to see a funny movie, you could see @78340 .  Then, on another night, go see @204870  together.
Oh that sounds like fun.
I have seen the first one and I love it.
If you are in the mood to see something that won awards, I loved @104180 .  Great soundtrack, too.
I don't think I have seen that one.
I will definitely have to check that one out.
If you are in the mood for a good action movie, you could watch something like @112069
Oh that is another one that I have wanted to see.
well this sounds great thank you so much.
nếu bạn thích musicals at all, you would like @104180
Thank you!  I hope you have a great day!  Have fun!  Goodbye.
You have a great day.  Good bye.
Hello!
What types of movies do you enjoy?
I'm in the mood for a horror movie.  Do you know of something I'd like?
Well let's see...
@141963 is a classic
@79665  is good
I like the old ones like @90552 but I also like the newer ones like @180224
@180224  is awesome!  Have you tried @194556 hoặc @178624 ?

hello
Hello!  I'm in the mood to see a &quot;found footage&quot; type of movie.  You know, similar to @162466
That should be @187879
Ohhhh a classic
How about @84195 ?
Or even @168803 !
I haven't seen either of those.  They are found footage types of films?
@126304 is an under the radar gem too
all 3 are found footage hoặc found footage-esque
Coool.  I will look them up!  Thanks for the suggestions!
No problemo!  Have a good one!
I really loved @206072
Hi
Hello!
I know this will sound crazy, but my AC went out today and it's hot.  I want to watch a movie with SNOW.
Totally understand that.  @141101 comes to mind
@83436 is good too
Oh, yes.  I just felt chills thinking about that.  LOL.
Maybe even a Christmas movie?
maybe even @176542
Something like @124142 ?
@88747 is pretty wonderful for that genre!
I love @176542 and my son is always up for that.
I haven't seen @88747 .  I'll look it up!
@191342 is a fun one for kids
Hopefully I helped!
Those are great suggestions!  You did help.
You have a great afternoon!  Goodbye!
Hey
Hello!  How are you?
I'm well, you
?
Great, thanks!  I'm in the mood for something with suspense.  Just as an example, I really loved @112719
Such a great movie!
@98699 for sure
Wasn't it, though?  It was great.
@155467 too
I haven't seen @98699 .
Could even go @146771
I've seen @146771 , loved it, but haven't seen @98699  hoặc @155467 .
You're trading Ben Affleck for Casey Affleck between Gone Girl and Mystic River but it's worth it
I'll have to look those up.
Zodiac is on Netflix and it's great!
Thank you for the great suggestions!  Those make me happy.
Hope I gave you a winner!
You did!  You have a nice day!  Goodbye.
Hi there, how's it going?
Hello!  It's going good.  Except, I really need a movie suggestion.
I want to see something inspirational.  Do you know of something good?
You know, like @140750 , but it doesn't have to be sports-related.
I recommend the movie @113392
I've seen that one recently and it's great, but maybe not good tonight because I've seen it so recently.  Anything else?
It's very inspirational and has great acting
What about @190285 ?
Oh, yeah!  I haven't seen that in ages.
That would be a good one to see.
Yes, I love that movie. Another good inspirational movie is @196460 . It's a sports movie though
I don't mind it being sports.  I just didn't want to make you only select sports movies.  That sounds good, too.
Thank you for the suggestions!  I have what I need.  I'll have to check out @196460 .
You were a good help!  Have a nice night!
Goodbye.
sounds good, good night
Hello
Hi. Who's your favorite actor?
Sam Rockwell hoặc Tom Hanks
Did you see @113035 ? Rockwell won the Oscar.
really liked @174560 and @111099
loved three billboards!
i openly wept haha
Did you see Hanks in @157783 The critics ddin't like it
I haven't
the cultish one right?
how was it?
Boring. Fractured story line. Didn't know if it wanted to be action hoặc drama.
Well at least I know to avoid it!  Thank you!
YW.
Well have a great evening, I appreciate the help!
Hi
Hello!  How are you?
I'm well, thanks! Who is your favorite actor/actress?
I don't really have a favorite to be honest.  I'm in the mood for a sci-fi movie, maybe something comedic like @191421
love that movie!  such a good cast
@176027 is fun
Yes, it was funny.
I've never seen that one.  It's sci-fi?
@155969 is a great film
it is!  it's based off of a show
Oh, yes.  I like @155969 a lot.
did you see @182674?  It's not bad and the sequel is good too
I'll have to see @176027 .  Don't know how I missed it.
Yes, LOVE @182674 .  I didn't think I would like it since I love the old actors, but these new guys are great.
You've given me some great suggestions!  Thanks!
I think I'll queue up @176027 .
No problem.  nếu bạn thích it check out Firefly after!
Have a great night!
Cool.  You, too!  Goodbye!
Hi
HI. Can you recommend a good musical?
I know a few!
@206064 is wonderul
so it @105764
@204651 gets in your head too haha
I really wanted to see that. Hugh Jackman is amazing
and there's always the classic @152744 hoặc even @106887
He's a good Wolverine and a good singer.
Thanks for the ideas. I'm going to check them out.
Awesome!  Enjoy!
Hey! If you could watch only one genre of movie, what would it be?
Hello!
That's tough. Probably sci-fi. Covers a lot of ground
You might light @159503 with the actress from @170174
I've heard of that one but never saw it
Chris Pratt and J-Law right?
I liked @155969
Yes. I didn't see that one. Does @90248 count as sci-fi?
I would say so.  Loved it!
Excited for the sequel
Thanks for the Passengers idea, I'll have to check it out!
Me too. Hope you enjoy it.
Have a good night!
Hi
Hi. Do you like classic movies/
I do but I'm kinda looking for movies kinda like @135485 !
Have you seen @110309 It's not campy like BTTF, but it's an interesting premise
I have not, I'll have to check it out
I also watched @181299  recently and loved it
Morgan Freeman is a God. Loved him in @189328
He's great in a lot of things.  I forgot all about Evan Almighty.
You might like @200523
hoặc @144701
I did enjoy that quite a bit!  Loved the references.  Never saw Tron.  Might look into that tonight.
Thanks for the suggestions
YW.
Hi! How are you?
Hello, what kind of family friendly films can you recommend?
I'm thinking things like @151357
Right now my family loves @204651 . nó có great music and Hugh Jackman is great in it. My kids can't stop singing the songs!
Oh, I saw @204651 it was wonderful!
what about tyler perry? I liked @182269
@187738 was great too!
I don't really know Tyler Perry, but @120948 is a great family movie. @113392 is also great but maybe more suitable for older kids.
@120948 I haven't seen in a while. and @113392 was really good as well, thanks!
You're welcome!
Have a great night!
you as well, thanks!
Hello!  What kind of movies are you into?
I like action and romance!
Like @172660 and @175096
Okay!  I have a good suggestion that give you both.  @182697 . It's old but I think it's still good.
I have seen that one several times! I love a lot done by Nicholas Sparks too, So that type is a favorite! What about you? What is a favorite?
@172660  I've not seen.  @205480  is great.
Oh you have to watch @172660 , serious tear jerker but wow what a movie!
I recently saw @205170 and that was REALLY good!
I'll have to watch it.  If you want to see an anti-romance movie, @112719  would be good.
I don't think I've seen that one, I'll add it to my list thanks! What is it about?
It's a thriller based on a book.  I won't give it away, you should just see the preview and watch it.  Everybody loves it.
Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I'll check it out! Thanks :)
I'll check it out! Thanks :)
le?
I hope you have a great night!  Goodbye!
I have no clue what happened there... so sorry!
Ok you too!
Hello!
Hi there! What type of movies are you into?
I was thinking of seeing something with Christopher Walken tonight.  Any ideas?
Hmm Ever seen @132127 ?
An example of a movie I liked was @82001 .  He was great.
I saw that but it's been awhile since I saw that one.
It might be worth a look.
Not sure I've ever seen that one! I'm not very knowledgeable about that actors movies...
He was an arch angel in it, really evil.
Have you see @183293 ?  Based on Stephen King.
Oh ok, so you're into drama! How about something like @127674 ?
That is a great one.  I haven't seen it in years.  I might queue it up!
Thanks for the suggestion!
And no I haven't seen @183293
Oh, Chris was also in @91332 .  Small role.
But, he gave a great speech.
You're welcome! :) Another personal favorite is @172660 , it's amazing! Has Brad Pitt in it.
I have yet to watch @91332 ! Heard a ton about it!
You have to see it.  Thanks for the suggestions!  I hope you have a great night!  Goodbye!
You too! Bye!

It's very good!

Hello!
Hello to you!
What kind of movies can I help you with tonight?
@205430 is new and very good, just a starting point
Can you find me some movies similar to @77455 but more modern?
That's tough.  Quiet a masterpiece there
@204904 has potential
Very true!
I've never seen that one. I'll have to check it out.
What did you like about Citizen Kane? Maybe that'll help drum up some more
Actually, @89838 might be up your alley now that I'm thinking about it
The story was interesting how it connected the character to his never being enough.
I have seen that one. It was fantastic.
Thank you!
Have a great night!
You as well!
Hi!

Loved that and Analyze That
Great! Glad to help
Have a good night
Hello, good evening
Hello!  I'm looking for a movie to watch with my 11-year old son for family movie night.  Any ideas?
@154844  always gets kids excited
I know my daughter loves @108278  and @101005
That's a good one, but he's seen it a few times.  Maybe something for older kids?  It's okay if it's PG-13.
I can practically hear the songs in my head
Those are good, too.
Oh well @78418 was pretty good
always good for a rewatch
Maybe something along the lines of @82602 .
@78418  is good.
He would probably like seeing it again.
I'll run that by him and see if he's interested.  Trying to get him off the games.  Thank you!
Oh, so you want somethng from back in the day. Hm @170277 was pretty great for a watch
Okay do that then
Oh, that is a good movie!  I didn't think of @170277 .  Great suggestion!
I like retro movies.
Hopefully he shares your taste in movies
You have a great night!  I have some great suggestions from you.
Great. Bye
Goodbye!
Hello!  What kind of movies are you into?
Hi!
All kinds!
Cool!  What are you in the mood for?
Really loved @174560 and @141578
also loved @155969
I've never seen @174560 , but I think I did see @141578 .  It's been awhile!  How about @77946 ?
Oh!  That's a favorite actually!
@161546  is a great watch.  Is that something you like?
I've actually heard a lot about it and never saw it.  Great choice!
Thank you!
Well I hope you have a great night!
Cool.  I liked that one.  I'll have to look up @174560 .
You should, it's great
And, I loved @155969 .  You have a great night!  I'm glad I could help.
Goodbye.
Hi
Hello and good evening
What's your favorite movie?
I have so many movies I like to see but no favorites. I am in the mood for a fantasy movie though. Like @161572
Have you seen @124433
Oh I have heard about that one but never actually watched it. I think I'll finally check it out
Any others like it? Maybe like @187310 etc?
hoặc @93739 Benedict Cumberbatch voiced the dragon
I love Benedict Cumberbatch
I might just watch that just for him
Did you see him in @143220
It was better than I expected.
I actually loved that one.
Thank you for these
YW.
I will rewatch @143220 and check out @93739
Good night
hello
how are you?
Hello!  I'm good. How are you?  Are you looking for a movie suggestion?
Always!
I just watched @143198 so that's where my heads at
Have you see @161723 ?  It's a classic, always great to see.
@161723  and @177979
Yup!  Loved that whole series
Even loved the spoof @121453
nếu bạn thích gangster films but want to see something that is lighter, you could see @180131 .
nó có Marlon Brando and Matthew Broderick.  Great film.
I've never seen taht one
I do love Broderick!  He was almost the lead in Breaking Bad
It's funny, and Marlon Brando is playing a &quot;real life&quot; gangster that looks like Marlon Brando (if that makes sense.)
It does. I'll have to check that out!
Thanks for the tip!
I don't think I saw @121453 .  I'll have to look it up.
Oh, and @91332 .  So great!
One of my other favorites!  Great call
That is a perfect movie.
I hope I've helped a little?
@88267 is great too
Yes, that's good.
You have!  Have an awesome night!
You, too!  Goodbye!
Hi
HI.
I'm planning a girls night out with my sisters. Can you recommend a funny movie?
@85159 and other Adam Sandler stuff from the early 2000s
I loved @150451 and @125280 as well
I don't care for him really. Too silly.
I love him. What about @166052 ? I guess Jim Carey would be too silly for you too
What kind of comedies do you like?
Haha yes.
@174475 was a good watch for me
My brother like Will Ferrell. The only thing I've seen was @111918
Yeah that is a good one
I'll get my sisters to vote on your suggestions. Maybe I'll come to love Adam Sandler
I dont find much of todays comedy movies to be hilarious but you can check out @98088
I really liked that one.
Great. Adam Sandler's older stuff was pretty good so he might grow on ya
Happy watching
Thanks for the info
bye
Hi
Hello!  How are you?
I'm interested in seeing an old-fashioned cheesy road flick.  Something similar to @157029
Ok. Thinking
While that one is great, we saw it recently so I'd like to see something a little different.
Ooh there's one on the tip of my tongue. Give me a minute
@109911
Okay, no problem.  I'll mention one more that we like:  @134157 .
Oh, yeah!  @109911 .  I remember I liked it, but I remember so little about it.  Just the name.
That sounds like a good one to see.
What about @158528  I love con men movies
Yes, that's a fun movie, too.  And, I can play the theme song on the piano.
Impressive
You've given me some good suggestions!  Thank you!  I am going to look them up.
Great. Talk later.
Goodbye!
Hi
How are you?
Hello
What is your favorite movie?
Either @134106 hoặc @148871
@187028 was good too
Have you seen @86397 ?  Also, @100646  is a good movie.
I enjoyed  Batman Forever, never saw Deep Impact
I'll have to check it out
I know I've heard of it over the years
Great!
Have a good night!
You too!
hi
Hi.
I just saw a trailer fhoặc @136912 It's a live action version of @178715
It looks amazing. Great voice talent. Kate Blanchett, Naomi Harris, Benedict Cumberbatch
Cool. I am not a fan of live action movies though especially if it includes singing
Looking for a nice chickflick movie for tomorrow. Some friends are coming over and I want to show the sappiest movie I can find
@123589 hoặc @109030 the original one. Not that Lifetime fiasco
Oh wow I have never seen both of those but I will gladly check them out
Can I get one more?
It's old but I really liked @124457 It's a tear jerker
:'( I will just have to check it out. Been a while since I've had a good cry from watching a movie.
Thank you for these
you're welcome
Good evening!  How are you?
Hello1
I'm good.
My husband and I saw @137985 and he enjoyed it so much.  I am looking for something similar, hoặc maybe with some of the same actors from that movie.
Jeff Bridges was sensational in that film.  My husband likes westerns, but he likes other things, too.
Okay. I have a few ideas. Give me a minute
Sure!
Have you seen @124848?
I have not seen that one.  Is it a western?
I bet my husband would love it.
It is a western.
Cool.  Now, if I'm picking for me, I loved Jeff Bridges in @170452 .  Most people aren't crazy about that one and my husband hates it, but I don't understand that.
The music in @170452 just made the film have such flow.  It was great.
Any other suggestions?
@83814 has Jeff Bridges in it and it is a western. You should both like it.
Oh, yes.  I think I saw the old version years ago, but not the new version.  I'll definitely look that up.
Thank you for your suggestions!  You are great!
Have a good night.  Goodbye.
Thank you and you're welcome.
Good night!
HI
Hi. What's the first movie you remember seeing in the theater?
@108668

Pick on: Marvel hoặc Justice League
Movies, marvel.  Comics, DC
I did like @177160  and @119144 though
Which one is @119144
DC
I'm kind of over super hero movies but loved @204974  Saw it twice
Very good movie! Perfect casting!
Well it's been great chatting.  Have an awesome night!
You too
Hello!
Hello!  My son just went on summer break and I'm thinking of watching some summer themed movies.  Something similar to @95240 .  Can you think of anything?
It doesn't have to be a comedy, but we like comedys.
Have you seen @92098 ? He might like that.
I haven't seen that one.  I bet he would like it.
I'd probably like it, too.
@161385 is another good movie!
I've been thinking of @201999 , too.
Oh, @161385 .  I hadn't thought of that one.  Great suggestion.
I think I will look up @161385  and @92098  and see if I can interest him.  Thanks for the ideas!
He might also like @115021 .
That one doesn't ring a bell.  I'll have to see what it is.
The name treehouse makes it sound intriguing, though.
Thanks for the suggestions!
You have a good night!  Goodbye.
You're welcome. Have a great night!

I am looking to have a movie night with friends, would you have any suggestions?
Are you interested in chick flicks? @140066 is a good one.
That movie is hilarious.
The scene where they all get sick at the dress shop is the best.
That was funny!
I love a bit of everything. I really want to see @204870 but just don't have it in the budget at the moment.
@78340 is a great one.  Funny and action packed.
Have you seen @168664?

I always forget about that movie! I am going to have to rewatch that again soon.

I've seen @185139 but not @119935 .  I'll have to look that up.
youll enjoy it very emotional movie
Cool.  Anything else you can think of?
@171718 was also sad at the end
Oh, yes.  My son likes that one and it was sad at the end.
I like @197322 , too.  Have you seen it?
I have not seen it ill check it out
hop[e you enjoyed the suggestions have a great day
Okay.  Thanks for the suggestions!  I think I will look up @119935 .
Goodbye!
Hello How are you?
Hello!  I'm good.  Do you know of any movies similar to @201091  that I might like?
I'm not so much into teenage movies unless they are smart.  Like, @123075 , for example.
That's a good movie.  You might want to check out @138780 . It's a very good movie.
I've never heard of it!
I'll look that one up.
Oh, nó có Emma Stone.  I would love that.
There is another one that comes to mind that is worth watching @163586.
I don't think I've heard of that one, either.
It seems to be a realistic portrayal of how rough growing up can sometimes be.
Another one I liked was @142617 .  It was funny.  Did you see that?
No I have never seen that one.
I'll look up @163586 , also.
I am going to have to look that one up.
Thanks for the suggestions!  I appreciate it.
You have a good night!
Thank you.  Good bye.
Hi how aren’t you
Hello!
Are*
I'm not bad
What kindness of movies do you like
I like comedy and action
I love movies like @184098 and @78418. Have you seen those?
I have not seen guardians of the galaxy ! Nhưng I seen the Avengers . Have you seen @205163
I haven't seen that one yet but I've heard it is really good!
Super goood! What about @204974 ?!
I seen it 3 times ! Lol
I haven't seen that one. I need to.
Yes it will be worth it
Have you seen @127115? It is hilarious!
Have you seen @85951
Noo!!! Nhưng I will definately check it out :)
I have seen that one! Pretty funny.
Do you know if it is on Netflix ?!
It is! You should totally watch it tonight!
Goood! Can’t wait lol thank you soo much have a great night :)
You too! Enjoy the movie!
I will!!
Bye
Bye
Hello!  What kind of movie are you looking for tonight?
Hey, you know any good horror flicks?
Sure, I love horror although I'm a fan of the older movies really.
As am I.
I love @184951 .  It was well-written and even the sequels are decent.
Yes @184951 will always be a favorite of mine.
One of the scariest movies without gore I've seen would be @131178 .  But, if you've seen it before, it would probably be ruined for a 2nd viewing.
The twist makes that movie and once you know it, it can't be unknown.
I like the @125431  movie.  I haven't seen the 2nd one yet.
I'm not sure if I have hoặc not.  That sounds like @170119 once you've seen it the twist is gone.
@125431 is a good one for sure.
Yes, exactly!  But, watch it if you haven't seen it.
I hope this helps you?
Well sounds good I will look these movies up thank you.
Good bye.
Thank you!  I hope you have a good night.
Good bye.
Hello!  How are you?
Hello. I'm great, How are you?
I'm doing well, thanks!  What kind of movies are you into?
I like everything.  You have any good action super hero movies?
Sure!  I really loved @184098 , and the sequel, @111429
I haven't watched either of those yet.
@134106 never disappoints either.
I am going to have to check them out for sure.
Oh i just watched that one yesterday.
I love Batman.
My favorite superhero movie of all time is @108195 .  So sad that Margot Kidder died recently.
That is so sad.  It's been years since I've watched that one.
I've been wanting to watch it again after I heard of her death.  I think I liked @78504  even better, though.
I will have to watch them both.  nó có been so long.
Well thank you.
Finally, I would suggest @136632 .  It's the last thing I saw in a movie theater of late and it's so good.
I hope I have helped you out.
Oh yes I will have to look into that one as well.
for sure. Thank you.
good bye.
I hope you enjoy your movie!
Good bye!
Hello, how are you?
Hello!  How are you?
I'm doing well.  What kind of movie are you looking for?
I guess I am open to anything right now.  I was just thinking of one I haven't watched in forever, @121440 , have you seen this one?
No, I don't think I've seen that one.
It is hilarious you will have to check it out.
nếu bạn thích that type of movie, you might like @147538 .
I've never even heard of it.  I'm going to have to look it up.
Actually, @147538  is a comedy based on a true crime case.  Kinda crazy.
Oh that sounds very interesting.  That's like @88267 was based on an actual couple.
How about @166729 ?  That's a funny comedy with a warped kind of love interest.
I have to look up @88267 .  It sounds interesting.
I have seen it, but nó có been a very long time since I have watched it.
@88267 is great.  I highly recommend that movie.
Cool.  I will look at that.  @174394 is a crazy kind of love story as well.
I hope I have helped you out?
I have heard of that one.  Oh yes you helped.  Thank you. Good Bye.
Good bye.
Hello, how are you?
Good! I like dark comedies, like @81385,  do you have any recommendations?
Have you ever watched @87490 ?  For sure a classic.
Yes, I have and I enjoyed it. No fighting in the War Room!!
Or one that I always thought was a great movie @94487 .
I've heard of it, but have never watched it. I will have to check it out.
any others?
For sure it is a really good movie
gets in your head.
I will always suggest @177747 .
I've seen the movie and read the book, for sure a great one.
Oh, that's a good reocmmendation. I'll add it to my list. Thanks!
Have a good night!
thank you, good bye.
Hello, how are you?
I'm doing well, thanks!  I'm interested in finding a body swap type of movie.  Something similar to @126044 .  Can you think of anything?
There is a movie called @132674 where two guys somehow switch bodies
I've never heard of that one.  Sounds interesting!
It could also be a movie where a person swaps roles but not bodies, like @76356
hoặc @184206 , sort of a funny version of how body swapping can go horribly wrong.
Right!  That movie is crazy.
I haven't seen it in awhile, either.
I thought that it was hilarious.
Of course, there is @126305 .  We saw that one recently, though.
Otherwise too @156698 might be something along those lines as well.
Oh that is a good movie too.
Yes, @156698  is a great suggestion!  So funny.
Well I hope I helped some.
Thank you for your help!  I am happy with looking these up, particularly @132674 .
You have a great night!  Goodbye!
Awesome.  Good bye.
Hello!  Can I help you find a movie?
Hello that'd be great.  What would you suggest?
What is your favorite kind of movie?
Or, what are you in the mood for?
I like everything but my all time favorite it horror movies.
Yes, I love horror movies.  I enjoy the old ones.  How about something like @99244 ?  Always a crowd-pleaser.
Yes that is one of my all time favorite movies.
Right up there with @77161 .
I never get tired of the old movies like @193742 .  The dialogue is a bit stiff, but the concept and scares are great.
Freddy Krueger is the man of horror for sure!
I don't think that I have ever watched that one before.
I will have to look it up.
Do you like old ones like @148114 ?
I have heard of it but I have never actually watched it.
I suppose I am going to have to check it out now.
Oh, and one that I remember scaring me when I was young was @170540 .  I wonder if it would scare me now?  I remember it was gory.
Definitely see @148114 .  nó có held up well.
I've never seen that one either.
I guess I have a few movies to look up now.
I hope you have something here you can use?
Thank you very much.
Cool.  I hope you have fun watching something!
Oh for sure.  you have a good one, thank you
Good bye.
Good bye,

hi there!
Hello!
how are you?
I'm doing well!  I am interested in finding a movie that my older mother would enjoy.
She doesn't like violence and tends to like family-oriented movies.
But, she likes a good comedy, too, as long as it isn't too raunchy.
She loved @88655 , for example.
Do you have any ideas?
great
Do you think she would like @96197
I've never heard of that.  Is it family oriented?  I'll look it up.
Oh, if nó có Judi Dench, I know I would enjoy it for sure.
I think she'd be pleased.
Yes!
I'm trying to think of some other good ones for you.
She likes older movies.  She loved @172264 for example.
Would she like a movie like @98683 ?
That is a pretty fun family movie?
That is a fun movie.  I'm not sure if she would like it as it's a little bit childish and dark.  My 11-year old loves it, though.  Haha!
lol true
But, I'm going to look up that other movie and queue it up for her.  Thank you for the help!
You are awesome!
no problem. Have a good one. Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Hello
i like crime movies
i like crime movies
you?
Hello!  I'm not a huge fan of crime movies, but I do like superhero movies.
I guess you could call a superhero movie a crime movie.
yes its similar
I love @108195 and my favorite superhero is @99583
Have you seen @119144 hoặc the new @78418
Iron man is the most common favorite superhero :D
I have seen both.  My husband loved @119144 but I wasn't as impressed.  I like @78418
Well, @108195  will always hold a special place in my heart as it was my first superhero movie that I loved.
But, Robert Downey, Jr. is great.
Its really a classic
Have you seen @78340
I think I'll queue up @78418 .  Thank you for the suggestion!
its a superhero comedy
Yes, it is.
LOVE @78340 .
I hope you have a great day!  Goodbye.

Hello
i love adventure movies
Hello!  How are you?
you?
I'm good.  I love them, too.  I recently saw @98433 with an orchestra playing the score.  It was fantastic.
I'm in the mood for some kind of 80's movie.  Any thoughts?
Its a great movie
ah yes of course a good decade for movies
and everything else also :D
Yes, it was!
Actually, adventure movies from the 80's are great.
Have you headr of @162573 hoặc @135485
Yes, those are great movies.
I loved @182697 , too.
I haven't seen @162573  in ages.  That would be a good one to revisit.
Tom Cruise was stellar in that one.
then @136552 is a great choice for you!

Yes, I've seen it.  It's great!
Thank you for the suggestions!  I think we'll put on @162573 .

Oh, and @136463 .   Scary fun!
i have watched those two
i really love them
im a big fan so i hava watched a lot of movies with him
:D
Cool!  I love the music from @162573 .  Of course, that movie catapulted him to success.
And, you can't leave out @140498 .  Sexy fun.
Have you seen those two?  I'm sure you've seen @162573  at the very least.
I havent seen the second one, but @162573 of course its a classic
Thanks i will try @140498
@140498  has the famous underwear scene where he's lip syncing to Old Time Rock and Roll.
Yes, you have to see it.
I hope I've helped you out?

Hello!
Hello!
I love great old classics you?
I do!  Especially some of the scary classics, like @94056 .
That was a great one
I don't think I'm in the mood for that, though.  I was thinking of going to see a movie at the theaters.  Do you have a suggestion?
oh yes let me think..
Maybe something funny.
I mean, maybe something funny would be nice.
Have you seen @204870 hoặc the new @78418
I haven't seen @204870 .  I did love the first one.
I wonder if people like @178258 ?  Have you heard any feedback?
Actually not
i havent heard of anything
I love the previews fhoặc @205376 .
But, I might just leave the kid at home and go see @204870 .  It would be a fun one to watch.
i know its a comedy, but the imdb rating is so low :D
It is?  I didn't realize that.
Im happy that i helped
have a nice nightout!
That's disappointing!  It might be one of those where the previews show the only funny moments.
You have a great weekend!  Thank you and goodbye!
Check it out you will se
bye!
Hello
Hello!  What kind of movies aree you into?
i love classic movies
do you know some good ones
I know lots of movies.  Any particular genre you are in the mood for?  Horror?  Comedy?
I re-watched @195424  recently
Maybe @94056 is a good reference
We saw it again because we have been watching that new show Cobra Kai which is fantastic.
Thats a great move myagi-son
:D
I love @94056 .  nếu bạn thích that movie, you'd love @198967 hoặc @127676 .
something else probably
oh i havent seen @127676
Hitchcock was a master at scaring the pants off folks, of course.
what is it about?
i love Hitchcock when im in the mood :D
These birds just seem to randomly start attacking people.  I think there was some reason for it, but I don't remember that much.  I just remember it was scary.
You would probably like something from Stephen King.  I would recommend @202190 .
i think thats a great choice for me!
Okay!  I'm glad I could help you!
i have seen @202190 its creepy
:D
Enjoy your movie and have a great day!  Goodbye.
You too all best!
bye
Hello
Good morning
Can you recommend a good movie for me?
what movie genres are you in the mood today?
I would like a cheesy comedy.
Something along the lines of @122385
Have you heard of @114801 hoặc @107420
I watched @114801 around Christmas so I don't want to see that.  I haven't seen @107420 .  Was it good?
Oh i remembered @149402 is gread! i really love Adam Sandler
Its okay lets say :D
I never saw @149402 and I thought I'd seen all of Adam Sandler's movies.
I don't know how I missed it.  I'll look that up.
Thank you for the help.  I appreciate it.
No problem anytime!
you will not regret it!
Have a great day!  Goodbye!

hoặc @111776 ?
@107171 was good, we are all Europeans so i think its a bit strange for us to watch :D
Nhưng i think we will watch @111776

THanks!
you too!

Hello!
Hello
what genres are you in the mood for today?
I'm in the mood for a suspenseful movie.
Something along the lines of @114231
ah
good movie type
Yes.  I like the movies that keep you on the edge of your seat.
Have you heard of @184418 hoặc @182709
Seven is a brad pitt classic
I've seen both of those, but I haven't seen @182709  in years.  Isn't that the one with the seven deadly sins as a theme?
@182709  isn't my cup of tea.  I'm usually not adverse to gore, but the scene where the man eats so much and  busts his gut just did something to me.  Haha!
Yes it is, a serial killer movie
I loved @184418 .
Have you seen @112719
Oh, yes.  That one is great!
I might re-watch it.
Thanks for the suggestion!  It is appreciated.
No problem anytime
Goodbye!

so pg13 movies are great
have you seen @122604 ?
or even @91583 ?
@206064 is a great middle ground

hi
Hello!  What sort of movies do you enjoy?
horrors and thrillers and mysteries
i liked @180899
and @128786
Oh, that's one of my favorite genres.  Did you get a chance to see @182858 ?
I didn't!  was it good?
I think it was a little graphic, but a lot of people seemed to enjoy it.  Do you prefer horrors and thrillers with a lot of gore, hoặc more psychological?
psychological really
good question
Ah, I see.  You might enjoy @180443 ; it's on Netflix and is definitely more of a psychological type.  It's sort of like @162907 , which is older but kind of along the same lines where people are trapped and have to find a way out, usually at the demise of others.
Thank you!  :-)
I'll have to give those a look!  I enjoy a good mind bend
thanks for the suggestions!
have a good morning
No problem!  You do as well!
hi

@78418 was great! Have you seen the sequels?
@169419 is a geat movie you need to saw it before @205163
Yes! I haven't seen that last one either but I do need to see both.
Thank you for the suggestions!
Have a great day!
you wellcome ! same to you!
Hello
Hello!  What kind of movie are you in the mood to see today?
I need a funny movie to watch with my ex

A funny movie to see with your ex?  Let me think.
Romantic comedy maybe
its kinda lame but i love her
How about something romantic like @191932 ?
We have watched that on our second date date
its okay maybe something like @104180
Of course, nếu bạn thích romance, you can't beat @84798 .
Oh, I loved that movie!  Such an awesome soundtrack.
Thats a great movie Julia is great!
You could see @124268 nếu bạn thích musicals.

It's better than the original. Nhưng I like the old-timey actors like Glenn Ford

Well that's not too hard hah
And Jeff Bridges in @83814

Hey
I really liked @193591

@181299
Or maybe @139492 . Nicholas Cage is in that, so it's kind of campy sometimes.
Loved both of those
never opposed to good ol camp!
And @78480  makes me cry everytime
Nicholas Cage was in @171914 too. Nhưng I wouldn't call it campy
never saw green mile but i'll have to check it out

steve buscemi's lynard skynard line!
well thank you very much for your time!
Hello!
Hi
I'm in the mood to see a fantasy movie, something that my 11-year old can watch with me.
Do you have any ideas?
We've seen @85875 together and liked it.
Have you seen @175843?
I have, but I don't believe he has seen it.  That's a good one to put on my list.
Also @171245 is also great to see as well.
It's been several years since I've seen @175843 .
I loved @171245 .  That's a good choice.
Another movie he might like is @176558
Oh, right!  I've seen that listed on Netflix hoặc someplace but never saw it.
Not as popular as the other ones, but still really good!
I'll definitely look into that one.  It came out the year my son was born, too.
He might find that cool.
Thank you for the suggestions!  I appreciate you!
I hope he likes those! You're welcome
Goodbye!
Have a great day!
Hello!
Hello! How are you today?
I'm good!  I'm looking for an adventure film, something like @77684
Do you have any ideas?
That's a good one! have a few ideas.
Cool!  I'm all ears.
There's the newer movie in the series @147598. Have you seen that one yet?
I haven't seen that one yet.  Is it good?
Wait, is that the one where they show him as a kid?
I thought it was great!
I'll put that on my list.  I also like adventure movies like @135485 .
I don't think he was a kid in that one. @135485 is an awesome movie! Have you seen @148231?
Oh, yes.  We love @101158  and we are looking forward to the new one this summer!
Another movie you might like is @169750. It was also directed by Steven Spielberg
I'm definitely going to look fhoặc @147598 .  Thank you for the suggestion!  Now, it's bugging me to remember which one had a young Indiana Jones in the movie.  Haha!
Yes, that is a great one, too.  I remember seeing that one with my son.
Thank you for the suggestions!  You have a great day!
You should rewatch all the @101158 movies before the new one!
Very true!
You're welcome!
Goodbye.
Have a great day!
Hello!  Are you looking for a movie suggestion?

@83586 its a great movie i saw it couple of times
The previews look good fhoặc @205353 .  I have a friend who said she loved it.

It is really funny.  Watch the trailer for it.  It's a fresh take on the slasher genre.
I hope I've helped you out with a few of these suggestions?
yes! i will seek for those movies thanks
Wait, I'll suggest one more that was on Netflix last I looked:  @110419

Hello, what kind of movies do you like?
Hy, my friend. Long time no see. How are you doing? Yesterday I watched an awesome movie with my husband @204409 . Can you recommend something simmilar?
I also watched @159657 but I liked @204409  more
nếu bạn thích mysteries, maybe @112719 would be a good one. Have you seen that?
I watched @112719 and I also read a book. And you are absolutely right, I loved it . @139048 is similar as well. I like those kind of movies
So what else can you recommend me ?
I recommend @111488 hoặc @158571
I didn't like @158571 . Nhưng I haven't seen @111488 . bạn có thích nó không?
Yes, it's a more modern take on a noir mystery film. I think you will like it.
Does that suggestion sound good?
It does! Thank you very much! Enjoy your day!
Thank you, goodbye!
Hi How are you?
Can you recommend me a best comedy of 2017?

I want to see @149829
I haven't seen @114341 .
not a regular Batman fan though
Do you think @149829 is kids friendly?
Me neither
I think it is, with slight adult references like they all seem to have
That's true. In your opinion what is the best comedy of all times?
oh, I am a huge fan @135571 and all of the sequels
HAHA I LOVE @135571 . It's so fun with good humor
Did you watch @133232 hoặc @203508 ?
Both, many many times but @135571 is my absolute favorite
I agree!!! I loved all of them @135571 , @133232 and @203508 , but @135571 is definitely the best
As far as I can see we have a similar tastes, so I'll go with the one you recommended me from the beginning @114341
Thank you!
Take care

Hello how are you?
Great thanks! How are you?
doing great.
Awesome! I just watched @140066 and @190814 and was looking for something similar- you know any good ones?
I also loved @88487 - that's a good one with a great soundtrack!
Those movies are so funny.
Let me think here I know there is one I am searching for.
A great comedy is always the way to go!
There is one @205376 it looks hilarious with Amy Schumer.
Oh wow! I haven't seen that but it does look hilarious!
I can't wait for it to come out.  Looks like it will be good for laughs.
Have you seen @135789 with Amy Schumer?
No I don't think so.  I guess I will have to check that out!
Yeah! Well, I'm going to look out fhoặc @205376 - thank you!
Have a great night! Goodbye!
Thank you too, havae a great night and goodbye.
Hey how are you?
I'm great and you?
I'm super- thanks! I love watching movies! What kind of movies are you looking for?
I love a little bit of everything, but how about a couple action movies.  Something fun for a movie night with friends.
I love action movies- I really like martial arts movies! @193168 is always a good one - funny and full of action!
I love that movie.
I love action as well I am obsessed with @183121 and have always wished I was a mutant, Haha!
Me too! Jackie Chan has always been one of my favorites! His newer one @145723 was a little darker, but good!
I LOVE comic movies!
Have you seen @205163  yet?
No I haven't seen it yet.  I usually end up waiting til movies are on DVD.
Or on my Hulu.
I think you'll like it, and @204870 was pretty great too- even has some Xmen in there, haha!
That's always a great way to go to not spend so much on movies.
Oh yes I love the first one.
You'll love the second one too, I think!
Well I definitely have some ideas here.  Thank you.
Of course! Have a great night- goodbye!
Have a great night.  Good bye.
Hello.
Hey! How's it going?
Good and yourself?
great, thanks!
I absolutely love the @93521 movies, and most movies based on great books- you have any ideas of a good one to watch tonight that's similar?
I really liked @89501 as well!
Those are great movies I never really got into them.  I always enjoyed reading my stephen king books and then watching those movies.
There are a number of great ones like @109453 .
I LOVE Stephen King!! I just got the new book The Outsider!
And I have a tattoo that says &quot;Constant Reader&quot;
Oh yes my father picked that one up.
@194336 was great! I also loved @117840 !
I meant @109453 was great, haha!
I haven't seen @194336
oh haha well that explains it
I think that it's crazy he changed the ending for the movie because of all the death threats he received.
Stephen King is always awesome! Thanks for the reminder- now I have an idea of what to watch tonight!
YES!
Good old Stephen King lol
Awesome.  Well you have a great night. good bye.
Thanks - you too! Goodbye!
Hello
Hello, what kind of movies do you like?
I enjoy science fiction movies, especially ones with space ship combat.
Do you like the @204292 movies especially?
They are not bad, but I tend to like @155790 movies more. @204292 movies seem more fantasy to me than science fiction.
Oh so you like the movies that have a possibility of being real? What about movies like @197213
Is that the Christopher Nolan movie?  I have not seen it.  Is it good, hard science fiction?
I haven't seen the whole thing, but it involves wormholes. I heard it was a very good movie. What about movies like @132885 ?
I saw @132885 and thought it was pretty good.
Thank you for the @197213 recommendation. I will have to check it out.
I enjoyed Christopher Nolan's other movie @134106
That is a good movie, have you seen all three? @168039
Yes. I saw all 3. They were good, though I was a bit disappointed by @148389
I enjoyed them too. It was nice talking with you!
Hello. What kind of movie are you looking for?
I'm looking for a good movie to watch on a date.
A romantic comedy then?
That sounds good. Do you know any good ones?
Have you seen @140335
I have! That is super funny!
How about @180926 ?  It is hilariously funny.
I haven't seen that one but I do love Steve Carell! Do you know any other movies with him in it?
He appears in @174475 and @116524
I haven't seen either of those. I really should watch them.
Thanks for the great ideas!
My pleasure!
Have a great night!
Good night
Hello!
What kind of movies do you like?
Hello how are you?
I like a little bit of everything.
I'm great!
I haven't seen anything like @154710 in a long time.
Do you know anything similar to that?
Have you seen @180251 ?
Oh yes I have that is also one of my favorites.
I love old western movies.  They are just so much fun to watch.
Another good one is @124402 .
@109449 is another great movie!
Oh I have not seen that one.
I am going to have to look that one up for sure.
There is also @150197
Oh yes that is a good one too.  Well that's great I think that will give me something to watch for a little bit.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome! Have a great night!
Good bye.
Hello how are you?
I'm great! You?
Same.
What kind of movies do you like?
I love it all but I am kind of in the mood for a romantic comedy.  Is there any chance you have something you could suggest?
@132728 is a great classic! Another good one is @142573 . Have you seen those?
I have seen the first one but not the secondd.
It is really good.
I will have to check it out for sure.
There is also @84798
Oh I love @84798.
And @116976 is really funny!
There is another one that comes to my mind that is more comedy than romance, its @121440 .  Such a great movie.
Oh yes I have seen that one too.
That is a good one!
That is a really funny movie.
Well it looks like I have a few options now.  Thank you so much.
Have a great night.  Good bye.
You're welcome!
Have a great night!
Hey how's it going?

I like everything to be honest, but how about some comedies.
Something like @90253 hoặc @85159 .
Do you like Adam Sandler? @150451 is a great one. And also @178472 and @198562
Have you seen any of those?
I have seen them all and I have to say that I prefer Adam Sandler's older movies.
His older ones are pretty great. He has definitely changed with his newer movies.
@198562 is ok but it's not as good as his older movies like @181301 .
Well I think I am going to have to watch some old Adam Sandler flicks now.  Thank you so much.
Have a great night, good bye.
You too! Good bye
Hey how's it going?
Hello
Going good. How are you?

Oh yes those are both great movies.
I also used to love watching @77161 .
That is a great one.
Yes I always love my classic horror movies.
There is a newer one out based on an old classic. Have you seen @187028
Oh yes I had seen @204794  as a child so I couldn't wait to see the new @187028 and I thought it was great.
Well Awesome I think I have some great ideas here for movies to watch.
Great!
Thank you so much.

I really liked @85301
That is a great movie and one of the first ones that came to mind for me.
@84766 was pretty cool...definitely a different genre.
bạn đã xem phim này chưa @195234 it is about an asylum so you see the Doctors and the patients.
I have not seen @84766
I have not but i've always heard good things
How about @120297? It looks like it would be a very good Dramatic Comedy.

I think I will check out both of them!

I like movies the whole family can enjoy. @83552, for example.
Yes I love @83552 ,Jack black was so hilarious
Have you seen @78480 ?

Yes @175096 is my all time favorite
maybe @161723
Well it was nice meeting you
Yes, you also. Have a good day.
how do we end
Hello!
What kind of movies do you like?
Hello
I love action movies
Oh, those are great!  If you are in the mood for an old-school movie, I would recommend @161313 .
And movies with dark comedies like @88487
If you want something more recent, there is that movie with the train called @151110 .
I have seen it, it's great!
@88487  was great, too.
If you don't mind gore, one of my favorite dark movies is @81385 .
although @153733 change the all terror type of movies
@81385 is great!!
Yes, I agree.  I am not a huge fan of @115463  to be honest.
I don't mind gore, but that one was just gore for gore's sake, if that makes sense.  I guess I'm getting old.
I hope you have a nice day my friend!!
You, too!
Goodbye.
Hello
Hello!
Do you like comedy movies?
I do.  I'm in the mood for a comedy from the 80's.
Do you have any suggestions?
@88487  is a great movie
from the 80's? Let me think
That is a good movie.  I like movies like @189705 .
@126305 is a great movie with Tom Hanks
Any comedy from the 80's is probably something I would like.  I'm in a nostalgic mood.
Oh, that is a great movie!
Yes, it is nice to rewatch old movies
Of course, @136983  was my favorite forever.
I think I saw it 3 times when it was in the theater.
I guess I love Bill Murray.
Other good comedy movie is @81385 , although is from the 90's
I hope you have a nice day my friend
You, too!!  Goodbye.
Hello
Good morning!
I'm in the mood for a movie with Mel Gibson.  Any suggestions?
Do you like comed movies?
@114932 is the best movie of Mel Gibson, he also directed
I do!  I really loved him in that movie @143020  which was a comedy.
Believe it hoặc not, I don't believe I've seen @114932 .
I've heard it's good.
Other good movie of Mel is @114759
You have to see it
Yes, I love @114759 .
I will have to queue up @114932 .
He didn't star it but he directed @134105
I also enjoyed @101794 .  He's great with Danny Glover.  Makes a great pair.
It was a very good movie
Yes, you right!
I hope ou have a nice day my friend
I think I did finally see @134105 .  It's been awhile.
Thank you!  You have a great day!  Goodbye!
Hello
Good morning!
I'm in the mood to see a movie.  Any suggestions?
Do you like comedy movies?
I do like comedy movies as well as others.
We really enjoyed @93013 .
Of course, you have to see @134106
Yes, that is a good movie.
We really love Will Ferrill here.
In comedy, @88487 is a very good movie, with a profond message
@88487  is good.
I like silly comedies like @197200 , also.
And @204478 is very good too!
Those oldies comedy movies are great!
I hope you have a very nice day my friend
Oh, we didn't like @204478 very much unfortunately.  My son liked it, but I felt like every funny scene was shown in the previews.
You have a great day, too!  Goodbye!
Hello!  How are you?
Hi! What type of movies do you like?
I'm in the mood for a movie with ghosts.  For example, @83586  was great, but it can be other genres, too.
Doesn't have to be a horror movie.
But, I do love horror!  Horror comedy is also great.
Have you seen @131178 ?
Oh, yes, but not in a long time.  That was a great movie with a smart twist at the end.
That's a good one.  Can you think of something else?
My son loves @91293 .  I'm not sure if I'm in the mood for that, though.
What about @90552? (It's an 80s thing)
That is one of my all-time favorite movies EVER.  Great soundtrack, too.
No ghosts in it, but you have excellent taste.  Love Kiefer Sutherland.
It's not ghosts, but have you seen @205430 ?
I have not seen it.  I've heard it's good.  Did you see it?
Yes. It's good. Some plot holes, so don't think about it too much, but it's fun.
I think we're going to queue up @131178  today.  Thank you for the suggestions!  You have a great day!  You are appreciated.
Thanks! Bye!

I also liked @184464

@148231 is a good suggestion, and he would love the gore and violence.  Haha!

What is yours?
@79278
@187310  that is.
Iv'e never actually seen that one.
Have you ever scene @172122
No. Is it good?
I think it's kind of sci-fi-ish.
Hmmm. Sort of like @145455
Except a little weirder
Lol, my Dad and I love to watch the old ones.
Thank you for the suggestions! Hope you enjoy your evening.
Hello!
Hey there, i'm looking for movies like @164063 age hoặc @157454 because I loved those. Do you know of any other good fairy tail movies?
I'm in the mood for a movie about summertime.  Something like @95240 , hoặc maybe even @187205
Oooh! @93252
Oh, yes, I liked @164063 .
That sounds good.
Both the dirty dancing movies were good.
Did you see @182858 ?  It reminds me of @164063 just because of the setting.
I've never ween @182858
It is frightening.  My niece hated it because it was so scary.  I thought it was cool.
These are all great recommendations. Thank you and have a good evening.
Hello!  How are you?
Hey there. I'm doing well. Can I recommend a movie for you?
I'm looking for a great old movie.
Any suggestions?
Hmmmm, such as @198004 ?
I loved that movie.
Yes, that's a good suggestion.
I also like suspense from Alfred Hitchcock like @175969
Or maybe old as in @153455 ?
Oh, I LOVE @153455 !
I've never seen north by northwest, actually.
I don't think my son has ever seen it, either.  I have to look for that one.
We watched Chitty as kids, lol.
@175969  is worthy of a look.  It is one of my all-time favorites.
Oh, and you can't mention older movies without mentioning @160038 .  Such a perfect movie.
I will definitely give that one a look.
Omg! A classic.
You have provided some great suggestions!  I do appreciate it!
Thank you and have a good evening.
Thank you and have a great day.  Goodbye!
Good afternoon.  What sort of movie are you in the mood for?

Oh, yes!  I loved @144701  but I admit I never watched @129036 .
I really enjoy the technology movies.
I have to say, if you haven't seen @170452 , I loved it.  I know the reviews weren't always kind, but I personally enjoyed it.
I will look into that one!
What about @85036 ?  That is such a cool movie.
That's a good one too.
Thank you for the suggestions!
And, I like robot movies like @99660 .
Thank you!  You have a great day!
I've never seen that one, but okay have a great one.
Goodbye!
Hey there. Can I recommend something to watch?
Hello!  I'm looking for a good movie based on a book.
Hmmmm. I don't suppose you like @194583 ?
An example of that would be @112585 .  I read the book and saw the movie.  The book was better.
I certainly didn't, lol.
Oh, I've never seen that one.
Yes, I actually do like @194583 .  I haven't seen that in awhile.  Read the series.  My guilty pleasure.
Haha, well to each her own.
Right!
If you have ever seen @86619 , @112585 is by the same author, John Irving.
Another movie that is based on a book is @203331
Oh, that one makes me cry EVERY TIME.  Yeah, I'll pass, not in a crying mood.  Haha!
That one was one of my favorites growing up, Old yeller, that is.
Haha! I know.
We used to watch it every time it was on, too.
Thank you for the suggestions!
You have a great afternoon.  Goodbye!
I've never seen @86619
You too! Good night.
Goodbye!

Hello!  I'm good.  I'm looking for a Kevin Bacon movie.
what tipe os movies do you like
I was thinking about him because we saw @155081  again recently.
I remember it was a good scary movie that didn't do as well because @170119  was out at the same time and everybody went crazy for that movie.
@144116
But, I've always loved Kevin.
I haven't seen that one.  It's good?
do you like kevin
yes is very good
I'll have to check it out.
how @106233
Oh, that's a classic.  Was he in that movie?
is a good movie
I don't think he was, but it is a good movie.
hoặc @146870
ok i have a great day
Another great Kevin Bacon movie is @96086.
good bye
Sorry, that should be @108019
Good bye!
Good bye
Hello. Have you seen any scary movies recently? Like @125431 ?
No, I have not
Do you enjoy scary movies?
I don't like scary movies. The last scary movie I saw was @193220
I saw that movie. It was scary.
How about @78418 ?
Do you like superhero movies?
I did see that movie. It was good
I love superhero movies
Me too! Did you watch @204974 ?
Yes I did. It was really good
I also saw @204870
Oh man. I haven't seen it yet but I want to,
It is honestly the best movie I have seen in awhile. Except sometimes the gore is a little too much
I agree.
It was nice chatting movies with you. Have a good day!
You too!
Have you seen @169487
No, I have not.
Dang that movie is so funny . One of the funniest movies ever made.
I don't really think I like that type of humor. I saw bits and pieces of the movie when it came on tv
Have you seen @192815
Yes . Well I have seen about 45 minutes of it before I decided to turn it off because I did not find it funny.
We have different type of humor I guess.
I haven't seen it either. Nhưng I heard it was really good
Ah . It depends , I just don't like Jack Black so him being in the movie is not a good thing
Oh. I like Robert Downey Jr, so that got me interested in it
Yea . He is pretty good in it from what i remember. Tom Cruise was the best part
I will probably finish that movie someday .
Have you seen @77115 ? That was pretty good
No I have not actaully. i Have seen all the @188057  movie series
Really excited for the next one coming out in a month
I have seen most of the mission impossible movies. The new one looks really good
Yea the 4th and the 5th one are so good. One of my most favorite action movies I have ever seen in a theater.
Have you seen @205430 by any chance?
Haven't seen it, but I want to. Just didn't feel it was worth seeing in theaters
Yea thats what I was thinking but I have been told my multiple people that its worth seeing in theater so I am probably going tomorrow.
Have you by any chance seen @178927 ?
I didn't know it was still playing.
I have not seen that
Thanks for the good conversation!
No problem . Thanks to you too.
Hello. Since you are in this chat. If you dont mind me asking , what is your favorite movie of 2017?
I think it was @205163
Oops, you said 2017
I don't remember what my favorite from last year was
Yea this year is not completed yet so I did not want to ask for this year.
That's fine . it is hard to remember
I did like Infinity War , It is probably my favorite of this year along with @205430
Have you seen it yet?
I have not seen that yet, but I want to. It looks good
Yea . It is really good , you should check it out while it still in theater. It wont be the same in your house.
I'll see if I can find the time to see it
Have you seen @204870 by any chance this year?
Yes I have. It was great
Yea . I loved it too although I personally thought the first one was better.
I don't know which one was better, but this one definitely did not disappoint like most sequels do
Yea not at all. I personally liked the first one better but the second was really good .
I'm having a difficult time coming up with a recent movie to ask you about
Have you seen @122604
Thats fine. I can ask you about a movie. I see a lot in my free time.
Yes , I loved that movie.
I saw that it is coming to Netflix, so I'll watch it soon
It is probably my favorite movie by pixar of this decade excluding Inside Out.
I haven't seen that one either. The previews didn't appeal to me though
Thanks for the good conversation!
Yea the previews did not appeal to me either but I was shocked by the movie.
Thank You .
Hello!
Hello !
What is your favorite movie of 2018 so far?
Hmmm.  I'm not sure.  I haven't been to the movies in awhile.  Tonight, I'm interested in seeing something with a serial killer.
An example of a movie like this that I like is @203424 .
Yes , i have seen that movie . It is good.
Have you by any chance seen @155467 ?
No, I don't believe I have.
That sounds like a good one, though .  I've heard of the Zodiac killer.
It is about a serial Killer and nó có Robert Downey Jr and it is directed by David Fincher
You will love it
Nice!
I like fantasy serial killers, too, like Freddy in @77161 .
Although, I should say that movie hasn't aged well.  It's more campy than scary now.
It was scary back in the day, though.
I dont really know much off the top of my head about fantasy serial killers. Nhưng have you seen @180224
Its a horror movie about a killer and they have to find out who is the killer
I wonder if it is based on the Zodiac killer?  I believe that was a true killer.
Yea that movie Zodiac is based on the Zodiac Killer
I'll check it out.
I also like the classics like @99244  and @130591 .
Thank you for the suggestion!
Dang I have not seen many classics . Nhưng I do think you should check out @115463
I'm not a huge fan of that one unfortunately.
I don't mind gore, but when I started watching that one, I just had to turn it off.  I must be getting old.  I used to not mind it.  Something about that movie.
I'm definitely checking out @155467 .  It helps that I love Robert Downey Jr., too.
Yea that makes sense. Well I hope you check out some of the movies I told you
They are really amazing and I loved them.
You have a great night!  I will .
Goodbye!
You too. Thanks for the conversation.
Hello how are you?
good thank you. What did you think of the last james bond movie @183582
I haven't seen it to be honest.
I do like action movies but have always preferred super hero type.
Something like @183121 .
Did you see @119144
Oh, no.  I want to for sure but haven't really seen anything that came out sice 2016. Haha
*since
I really liked @177588
Oh yes I loved that one too.  I suppose my favorite was @138141.  Nhưng there are more that I haven't watched yet.

Hmm, lets see...
A good start would be @204331  and then maybe @205435
After that I'd say, @84273 hoặc @189592
I heard they are both hilarious.
Oh I love both of those movies.
Also @98088 and @165438 were hilarious too.

Hi. How are you?
I'm doing good, how about you?
I'm well, thanks for asking.
So, you into animated films?
I'm actually in the mood for a musical film with a horror theme.
Oh, interesting
Let me think a moment on that.
An example of this is @114785 .
Oh wow, I actually was about to say that one lol but you beat me to it.
I loved that movie.
Sorry!  :)
I'm not sure I know of many horror musicals but I'd be able to recommend some horror films...
Sure!  Another good horror musical is @93310
I hear @125431  was okay
Oh wow, how did I forget that one?!
Yes, that's another classic!
Yes, I love @125431 .
I'd say @171615 while it's not quite horror I love the musical parts of it.
Yes, that's a good example.
Hah, nice!
nó có horror elements.  I mean, they kidnap Santa!
LOL. Right!
One of my favorites!
Love Tim Burton movies!
@107350 was a good one.  Johnny Depp singing.  Classic.
Oh wow never saw that.
It is good.  See it if you get the chance.
how about @148245  that wasn't really horror though.  lol
Thank you for the suggestions!
You're welcome.
Bye for now.
@148245  wasn't really a musical, but great Johnny Depp movie!
Good bye!  And thanks again.
Hello there!  How are you?
What kind of movies are you interested in today?
Hi, I'm great.  How are you?
Let's go with animated films like @159885  since I can't stop talking about my excitement fhoặc @205724
I can't wait until it comes out, either!
How about @171718 ?  My son and I went to see it with his friend this morning.
I recently watched @122604 that was such a cute movie.
Oh, I think I vaguely remember that movie.
Love @122604 .  Great animation, great music.
And I love @154844  and @162647
@171718  was playing as a $1 movie at Regal, a summer thing.
Yes, it was so good.
Oh nice!
If you can't remember it, look it up.  It's a fun movie.
I miss those days... I don't have a cinema like that around where I am now.
When I lived in Florida, I'd see a few movies a day.
It normally is not $1.  It's a Regal thing they do in the summer for the kids 2 times a week.
You had great suggestions with @154844  and @162647 .
I hope I helped a little?
Yes, absolutely!
I hope you have a nice day!  Goodbye!
I have to watch it with the nephew soon.
You too, thanks so much!

I also really enjoyed @197772 I just learned there was a @146231  I'll have to check out too
It never really gets old.
Yes, I loved it!
Are you into some of the Japanese films like @154920 ?  We love that one.  So imaginative.
I didn't see @75881 @161498  hoặc @138614
You have to see @146231 .  Especially nếu bạn thíchd the first one.
Not sure, never heard of it. Nhưng I will check into it.
Omg, yes I can't believe I didn't even know there was a part two.
Well, I hope you enjoy watching some of these animated films!
Thanks for your suggestions.
I will I'm sure.
Have a great day.
Bye for now.

Good afternoon!  I'm good, I hope you are as well.
What kind of movies are you looking for?
I am, thank you.
I love animated movies like @87294  hoặc @162647
Oh, I also loved @182731 that was such a great concept.
Those are great!  How about one of the older movies for a change?  Like @91327 .  Scott Bakula singing and dancing as a cat.  Can't beat it.
Never heard of them.
Nhưng I'll check them out.
what are they about?
Do you like the Lego stuff?  Like @175121 ?
Yes loved it.
I was going to add that to my list of I like lol
@91327  is about a kitty who takes off to Hollywood and tries to make it big in the movies.  Like, old Hollywood.  It's fun.
Aw, I'll definitely check it out.
Sounds like something I'd enjoy.
Thanks for the tip.
Bye for now, my friend.
How about a movie like @158803 ?  It's partially animated.
Hi, how are you?
Good afternoon!  How are you?
I'm great, thanks for asking.
I'm good.  What kind of movies are you interested in?
I'm really hung up on animated films... like @87223 and @98389
I'm so excited to have recently learned there's a part 3 coming 2018
Those are good.  How about a partially animated film like @158803 ?  It is a hoot.
OMG! Yes, talk about classic!
That reminds me of @95959
Yes, that was an awesome movie
Right! They don't make them like that much these days.
It was such an interesting concept too.
I love the mix of real world versus animation
I'm kinda excited fhoặc @204895 too lol
You might enjoy @149245 nếu bạn thích Disney.  Sad, but good.
Oh yes, I remember and loved that one.
Thanks for the suggestions.
You have a great day!

So what kind of movies do you like?
I'm interested in seeing a love story.  Something like @132728 .  Any ideas?
I'm not in the mood for something too sad, like @169159 , though.
Oh nice, how about @205480
Well then... maybe not that lol
Yes, that is a great love story.  It's sad, but I still think nó có a feel-good aspect at the end seeing her grow old.
How about @84798  that's a classic?
If only she could have moved over a bit on that piece of wood.  LOL
I really enjoyed @142573
LMBO!
Oh, yes!  Love @84798 , and I haven't seen it in awhile.
Another fave for me is @187205
Is @142573  the Christmas movie?  I'm trying to remember...
Yes, it is.
LOVE the scene where the boy goes to stop his girl in the airport.
And, @187205 .  Patrick Swayze...That's all you have to say and I love it.  :)  It's great.
LOL!
Yes, I agree!

Hello
Hi. @205375 comes out tomorrow.
I know I just might check it out
I only saw the first one but I am interested in what an all female cast will bring to it
Kate Blanchett doesn't usually do comedy. She was fantastic in @162658
and @200871
I liked her well enough in @169419
I have never seen @200871 but I might check it out
I still haven't seen that. Might check it out on demand
I thought @162658 was kinda boring.
ha ha I can understand that. There wasn't a lot of action
hope you find something you like
Thanks for these movies
see ya later
Laters
Good night
Hi.
Have you seen @204870 yet?
No. I didn't see the first one either. I'm kind of over superhero movies. Nhưng I did love @119144
Me too
I am still into the superhero stuff no matter how cheesy but that's just me :)
what are you into?
I like romantic comedies like @152847
Great one. I liked @90747
I haven't seen that one.
Basically the same thing whee the guy makes a bet/deal to win the girl over
Kind of like @203231
Not sure since I haven't seen that one.
Another romcom would be @123015
That was so funny. Betty White is a comedy goddess
Yeah she is
Hope you can choose one of these to settle in and watch
Thanks for the suggesitons
You are welcome

Nhưng @115523 was disappointing
Have you seen @150941?
I did. I thought it was just so-so. @106887 was really good
Yeah, I like that too.
Maybe a more classic musical like @197345 would work for you?
Believe it hoặc not that's one of my daughter's favorites. She's 15 and wants to be an actress
My niece is in drama club. They're doing @152744 this fall.

hoặc @170277
I like racing movies too, what is another good racing movie?
how about @141928
what else do you like ?
I also like comedy movies. Do you know any funny movies?
@183056 is my fav
hoặc @135571
I've never seen either of them. Sounds interesting though.
I think that's it goodbye!
@138962 was funny too
Hi, what's up?
Hello, can you please recommend a good action movie that isn't rated R?
They're hard to find. Let me think for a moment...
Okay.
nếu bạn thích action movies that are also sci-fi, there's @99276 and sequels.
@83552 is family friendly.
Yes, I did like all of the @99276 s movies. Our family loves @83552 . We watch it about once a year. I also like @139354.
How about @184098?
Actually, we watch the older @83552 about once a year. We haven't seen the new @83552. Maybe we'll give it a try. Thanks for the suggestion! We do like @184098 too.
There's also a sequel @111429.
I thought I selected the older @106233. Oops!
That's okay. I knew what you meant!
Yes, we've seen the newer @111429 too. I think we'll try the new @83552.
Enjoy and have a good day!
You too. Thanks!
HI! Can you reccomend any good comedies?
Hi. How are you? I sure can
How about @134643 . It's classic. Have you ever watched it?
Of course! It IS a classic!
You can also watch @163739
I haven't seen any of the sequels. Are they as good?
Yes I loved @163739
i will have to check it out!
If you want a movie that was released recently I would recommend you @205435
@205435 is really funny , I laughed a lot
Have not heard of that, but will take a look at it. I heard they put out a sequel to @111776 . Have you heard anything about it?
I have never watched @111776 to be honest. Is it a good comefy?
I thought so, yes. I didn't think I would be in to it, but it was much funnier than I expected.
I guess I have to watch @111776 now. If you enjoyed it then I would definitely watch @160690
Looks like I've got some movies to watch. It's been ages since I watched @134643 so maybe I will start by rewatching that and then check out the sequel.
That's a good choice ! I hope you'll enjoy
Thanks! Have a great day!
Hello! HOw are you? I am ooking for some good comedies. Any ideas?
Hi I really liked @142895
I don't think I have heard of that one,
Oh, it was hysterical - these gals all had been played by the same guy and they got together to teach him a lesson
I will check that out! I keep hearing that @140066 is funny. Have you seen it?
@140066 was very entertaining.  I also enjoyed @119662
OH my God! @119662 is one of my favorite Bill Murray movies!
With his little fish !
Yeah!  @119662 is a total classic.
ANy other Bill Murray films you would suggest?
@106132 is a popular one!
I love the original but have not seen the sequel. I wll check it out. Does he play the same groundskeeper guy?
Yes, he is typical Bill Murray.  How about @189705 ?  That's another Murray classic.
Lighten up, Francis !!!! yes! I love @189705
Thanks for the ideas. i am gonna go have a Murray marathon now!
@200089 was a bit different.
HIs newer films definitely have a different tone. I really liked @178331
Which is no longer &quot;new&quot; now that I think about it...
@178331 is one I haven't seen yet.  I am putting it on my list!
It is one of my favorite films.
Thanks for the recommendation!
If you have seen other films Wes Anderson has directed, like @139839 hoặc @154993 you will like it.
@139839 is on my list to see.  How about @107826 ?
I saw that and thought it was pretty damn good.
It kept me laughing.  You have to be in the right mood though hoặc it's just cheesy.
ALright! Have a great day! I am off to watch movies!
Hi, looking for a good drama film.
Have you seen @111063?
Nope.  I liked @168758
I also really liked @106588 but maybe that's more a thriller?
What about @108945?  That's kind of on the same tip as @106588
I haven't seen that one, but I did see @123083 and enjoyed it.
Was that the sequel to @178885 ?
Yep, it was.
I think you might also like @152883
nó có Gary Oldman and some other great cast members
Solid drama
Oh, I haven't seen that.  I will add it to my list of wanna sees.  How about a comedy suggestion?  I really liked @142895
What about @178096 ?
That's another one I've missed.  I did like @119662
That was funny
@189705 was another great Murray film.
Oh, gosh, yes.  Have you seen @190543 ?
I loved Bill Murray in that
Yes, and I think I have to go watch some movies RIGHT NOW!
Me too!
Thanks for the recces!
Hello! Are you a sci-fi fan? I have been looking for some good sci-fi movies. if not, any good comedies?
If you are in the mood for a comedy?  @142895  had me rolling on the floor
Sci Fi, I loved @155969
I have been meaning to see @155969
Oh, you should  There's another one about Mars @206079 you might want to check out
Have you seen @197213 ? I have heard it was a good, cerebral sci-fi flick.
Yes, I saw @197213 .  It was brainy.
I have not heard of that one. What is it about?
@101264 was good as well.
In @206079 a life form is found under the surface on Mars that threatens Earth
I just re-watched @101264 with my fiancee, who had not seen it. They were not impressed, but I have always enjoyed it.
Oh! That sounds good! Life on Mars is always a good theme!
How about @81475 ?  Tried that?
I have not. Thanks for the suggestions! Have a good rest of your day!
Hi--I'm looking for a good Sci Fi film
In the mood for some Sci-Fi?  Have you seen @77521
No, I haven't.
My favorite movie of all time is @147934
is it anything like that?
Just that it's Sci-Fi.  I loved Blade Runner as well!  How about @165416 that was GREAT!
Yes, I loved that
There's a 2018 film about Mars, @206079 that's awesome.
I haven't seen that, but it sounds interesting
You might enjoy it!  Did you like @193213 ?  Along the same lines as Blade Runner.
Yes!  I really liked that.  I sort of wish that Kubrick had been able to do that after he finished @198397
What about something scary?
I agree.  Well, I'm off to do some movie watcing now
Me too
Thanks for the recces!
Hi.  I love horror films.  I like @120092 Can you recommend something like that?
@120092 was awesome!  Have you seen any of Guillermo del Toro's other stuff, like @117515 ?
No, I did see that.  I really enjoyed @154114 and I also liked @206080
@154114 hoặc @131178 ?  I liked them both.
nếu bạn thích horror but want something a little different, you should check out @144263 if you haven't seen it
It's great
The @154114  from 72
Nope, not seen Suspiria.  What's it about?
Ah, okay.  Have you seen @131178 ?  It's a great horror movie, too.
@144263 is set in a dance school in Germany that is also a witch's coven.  It's very stylized 70s horror with a great soundtrack.
Sounds great.  I'm going to go watch some movies now!
Have fun!
bye
Evening!
Hello!
I recently saw the @204651 and loved it. Do you have any recommendations for musicals?
Sure!  Did you see @150941 ?
Oh, I've always wanted to see that, but have never got around to it... thanks!
Sure.  You should also check out @97153
I also like movies set in the past, so it will be perfect for me.
Would you recommend anything else?
Musicals hoặc something else?
Historical films hoặc musicals... I saw @181674 not so long ago and that was fantastic.
Although you can't beat @140704 for a good war movie :)
I haven't seen that yet.
@92441 is a great escape movie, too!  Check it out if you haven't
Oh I haven't seen it. @139492  is one of my guilty pleasures.
Yes!  Along with @171914.  Those two are like a guilty pleasure double feature.
Yes indeed. I
love Nicholas Cage too :)
And Steve Buscemi.  He's great in everything.
Yes... even as 'Crazy Eyes' in Mr Deeds!
Have you seen @188293 ?
Oh, that sounds interesting, I haven't seen it.
Buscemi wrote and directed that
I really liked it
Cool, I'll check it out. Thanks for the recommendations! Nice talking to you :D
And of course he stars in it
Nice talking to you as well!
Hi!
What sort of movies do you like?
I really enjoy drama/biography.  For example I enjoyed @204904
Oh, that's a movie I haven't seen. nếu bạn thích Drama, I really enjoyed @172660 recently.
I think that's on my list to see.  Did you see @122343 ?
Yes it was fab! I also really enjoyed @111540 - I haven't watched the original yet, but it is on my list.
Have you seen @111540 ?
That should have been @181674
Do you enjoy war movies?
Yes, loved @111540   I really want to see @205054 I didn't see it in the theater because the reviews weren't all that great
I do like the classics.. I can recommend @193710 and @178557 for a Sunday afternoon marathon.
I've not seen @205054 - I will have to check it out.
One of my favorite films was @79698
Jodie Foster?
I don't think I've seen it...
Oh, you'd like it!  Gotta go watch some movies now.
Is it similar to @110605?
bye
Yes me too! Nice to talk with you :)
Hi--I'm looking for a good ghost story
Ah! Okay.. let's see....
Maybe something set in the past
There are the classics, like @202190 and @170119
I liked both of those!  I also liked @131178
@202190 is the early 80s... which I guess is the past now... Jeez, I feel old lol
I have not seen @131178
Right?  Me too :).
I also like some of the Japanese horror movies that have ghosts
It's not a ghost story, but it is a good horror flick set in the past... @125540 is about Dr. Jekyl's maid.
Oh, wow!  That sounds really interesting.
I like costume dramas, so that sounds perfect
It is! very different. nó có Julia Roberts and John Malkovich.
What about anything else sort of like that?
I like costume dramas as well, and @125540 has a ton of costumes. Corsets and brocade everywhere
@121148 is very well done. Set in the victorian era, very well directed and photographed.
Nice!  @131976 is one of my favorites, too
@94963 is cheesy but fun, and it is heavy on the costumes and scenery.
I've seen @121148 and I loved the costumes in that, too
Gary Oldman has some pretty fabulous looks going on in that one for sure.
Still haven't seen @94963 , but I need to put that back on my radar.  Thanks for the suggestion!
Hi! What is your favourite movie?
I really like war movies like @181674
Me too! Have you seen @111540 ?
I haven't seen the original yet though.
yes, and I loved it!  I also really like @79698
I've not seen that one. I'll check it out.
I can recommend some old school movies too... have you seen @193710 ?
hoặc @151198 ?
I haven't seen that one hoặc that one either.  I will put them on my list.  I want to see @205054
Yes that one looks interesting. I also like things like @107554
Nope, not that one either.  @107554 was terrific.
Although you need a strong stomach for that one!
Well, we both now have some other movies we can add to our 'to watch' list!
Nice chatting to you!
bye
Hi!  I love documentaries, especially docs about musicians.  Can you recommend something?
There was that movie @138451
I recently saw @138042 and I thought it was great.
I haven't seen @138451 .  What's it about?
Not seen @138042 but I'll try it
How about @111782 ?
What about other documentaries?
Oh, I loved @111782 !
@138451  was about a homeless man who was a muscian
I also really liked @126740
Have you seen it?  It's about Beethoven
That one I haven't seen yet hoặc that one.  Time to go watch some movies!
@138451 sounds interesting.  Thanks for the recs!
Hi!  I'm looking for a movie about a sports team
How about @141210
I really liked @102157 , but it doesn't have to be about basketball.
I haven't seen @141210 .  I'll have to check it out.
Any other suggestions?  Any sport will work.
You might like @93839
I haven't seen that, either.  Can you tell me something about it?
A football coach befriends a mentally challenged young man in @93839
Ah.  So if I like @203526 , I might like that.
Sort of.  You ever seen @122138
Oh, yes!
Well, gotta go watch a movie!
Have fun!
Do you like drama?  See @204904 ?
Hi there!  I really love Billy Bob Thornton.  Can you recommend something besides @112596 that has him in it?
I haven't seen @204904 .
How about @177276 ?
I loved @177276 !  It was wrong in the best way.  What about something else?
I haven't seen @192326 , but I know he's in it.  Have you seen it?
There was @110685 that was pretty good
I haven't seen @110685 .  What's that about?
I don't recall him in @101479   Mr. Woodcook was a basketball coach
Time to go watch a movie.  Bye
Thanks!
hi there. How are you?
Great.  How are you?
Awesome.
What kind of movies do you like?
I like all kinds of stuff.  I'm looking for something funny to watch tonight
Do you have any suggestion?
Have you seen @205435 ?
No, I haven't seen it.  What's it about?
a middle-aged couple start their own casino in their house.
Super funny
Oh, wow.  That sounds great.  Anything else, maybe something that's already out on video?
Actually I got that confused with @188779
that is already on video
you should check that one out for sure!
I see that has Amy Poehler in it.  I thought she was hilarious in @183091
That was a silly movie, but I liked it
yes!
I like dark comedies, too.  What did you think about @127795 ?
never seen it
You should check it out.  It's really darn funny.  Two Irish hitmen in Bruges, which is a beautiful city.
sounds awesome
Alright. I hope you liked the suggestions. Have an awesome day.
Goodbye!
hi there!
how are you?
I'm good.  How are you?
Doing great!
What kind of movies do you like?
I'm looking for a solid drama
I don't care if it's an older movie
I love a good drama. Have you seen @91882 hoặc @120092 ?
I've seen @120092 , and I loved it, but I haven't seen @91882 .  Can you tell me something about it?
I actually haven't seen it either if I'm being completely honest
Nhưng it does have really good reviews.
Seems to have many religious undertones. So i'm guessing you would need to be into that.
No problems there.  Any other suggestions for drama?  I like to watch movies at home when I can, so it doesn't need to be a new release
how about @79968
?
I haven't seen it, either.  What's it about?
I see it was directed by guy that did @170119
Its about a guy who has 23 split personalities and one of them remains submerged in his subconscious. Very good movie!
Which I liked
Yes
It received good reviews too!
That sounds interesting.  I'm going to check it out.
Awesome.
Hope you like it!
Have a great day. Goodbye!
Time to watch some movies!
HI! What kind of movies do you like?
I like all kinds of movies.  I recently started watching a lot of old stuff on cable, and I really like Alfred Hitchcock, particularly @84837 and @101241.  Can you recommend any old movies?
Have you seen @89429?
It's a great book and even better movie!
I've seen a @158083 from 1940.  Is the @89429 based on the same book?
Yes.
Daphne du Maurier, right?
Yes. The same
That sounds interesting!
Of course, there's @77455...
Oh, yes.  I also loved @150846 .  I don't think Orson Welles is appreciated enough anymore
@202857 is also really great.
Thanks for the recommendations!
and @82321
You're welcome!
Ah,
yes,
How about a good romance, like @186139
oh thats one of my favorite movies, 80's forever!
Yes, I also liked @175096
have you sen the sixth sense?  thats one of my faves. it was filmed in my old neighborhood
I did like the @170119  and of course @102703
i dont think I've ever heard of @102703 whats it about?
Oh, @169159 is about a doomed love, girl gets sick and is dying
Really enjoyed @132728 too
oh that sounds too sad for me....my favorite movie is @133251 have you seen it?
No, is it a love story?
its a comedy - tom hanks is the star and its hilarious - highly recommended!
My favorite comedy is @142895

Time for me to go watch some movies.  Bye
thumbs up!
Hi, what types of movies do you like?
I'm looking for a really exciting action film.
Maybe not so much a super hero franchise movie
Have no seen the classics of the genre, like @161313?
That should be &quot;have you seen...&quot;
I liked @78418 and @78340 l, but yeah--something more like @161313 d, which I loved
Is there anything new out there like that now?
How about @102116, the original with Patrick Swayze?
You know, I've never actually seen that.
also featuring Keanu!
I should get around to that one!
Thanks for the ideas!
If you are willing to watching something older, @93383 is very good, better than the reboot, @121726.
I've never even heard of those.
I will definitely check it out
I love older stuff
Thanks again!!
the original has four stars on IMDB!
happy watching!
Hi there!  What kind of movies do you like?
I'm looking for something to distract me!  Maybe sci-fi like @162873
Sorry that would be @162873
Like @162873 ?  Hmmm.  Have you seen @77542 ?
It's sci-fi, but it's not too dark
I loved @77542 Also really loved the @191297
Or you could always go with a classic, like @182781
@182781 is a classic!  @155969 is outstanding as well
@191297 was great!
I need something new!
Have you seen @194044 ?
It's crazy
No, I haven't, what can you compare @194044  to?
I'm trying to think of a good comparison.  nó có time travel but it also has hit men.
And nó có a ton of action
Well, I will check it out!  Time to go watch a movie I think
Great!  Enjoy!
Hi, how's it going?
Good! Looking for a movie recommendation for this weekend. I like dark comedies, like @81385.
Have you seen @152496?
Yes. I love my dead gay son!
great movie
Another great dark comedy is @174148.
I've heard of that, but not seen it. I'll have to check it out.
You might also like @135084, the 2004 version. The older ones aren't as funny.
Great suggestion. Thanks!
Enjoy!

Hi, sorry for my delay.
I haven't seen them but I'm looking for a good animated movie like @159885
I hear @205724 is in theaters June 15th! I can't wait.
@205724 comes out in a few weeks
Have you seen any of those?
Yes, I'm so excited.
And @79408 was fun.
Have you seen @91547 ?
Oh I have to see that one still
There's a part 2 now of @206076
I'm a big kid at heart.
Yeah with all the Disney princesses. That looks fun too
But... then I'm also a stoner so I enjoy movies like @84273 and @111776
LOL.
Also excited fhoặc @160690
I'll have to check out the others you named for sure.
Well it sounds like you have plenty to choose from
Have fun watching everything
Yes, thanks for the recommendation too.
Have a great day.
Bye for now.
Hello, how are you?
Glad it's Friday.
Yes, me too!
So many good part 2 movies coming out like @205724 and @160690
We have a great indy theater here that plays @93310 every weekend.
Have you seen @111776  hoặc @159885

You made me think of @114785
Have you seen that one?
My daughter was stage manager for a local production one year
Wow, that's fantastic!
Did you get to go on set?
Not really. I helped iron costumes but that was about it. Speaking of musicals @97306 was surpsiingly good
Oh, I never saw it, I heard it was annoying because that song came on over and over.. so I took my friends advice and avoided it lol
Maybe I'll give it a try tho.
Thanks for the recommendations!

Hello.
How are you today?
If you haven't seen @204870 yet I'd start with recommending that
Even if you haven't seen @78340
However what kind of movies do you like?
Hi, I like Robert Redford @136418
Oh nice.  What genre would you say that is?
Don't like Marvel characters like @78340
Oh I see.
how about @91958
He made a lot of different genres, I guess Drama, Action, Romance like @104249  was Action
or another one would be @98879
or a classic like @153645
I see, I remember his name just not his movies, he was a big actor in those days.
Well, check out the others I've mentioned you may enjoy them.
@198209  wasn't a Redford Movie was it?
No, sorry I don't know all Redford movies...
Just giving examples of similar in genre
Yes @190837 was a great Redford movie!
Oh wow.  What a good guess on my part.
See, I learned something!
Going to watch movies now. bye

You might like it, it's a classic war movie.  Engaging though an oldie

Hello
Hi!  What's your pleasure?  War?  @199385  is a favorite of mine
I don't really enjoy war movies. I much prefer horror. My favorites are @202190 , @182858 and @78665
Have you seen @120092
No, but I'd like to
It won the Oscar for Best Film, right?
How about @109453
Yeah, I saw it a long time ago
I liked the book better but the movie was okay
I really liked @206080 though I thought the book was better
I've never heard of that movie
I'll check it out
I kinda thought of @155661 as a horror movie
It was definitely depressing!
Again, I preferred the book!  @89668 was good too
Can't go wrong with Brad Pitt
True enough!  Tell me one more of your favorites
I saw @205430 last month and was really impressed.
Oh, I am waiting to see that one.  Guess I'll go watch a movie now!  Bye

Oh, that's a good one.
I also like @80325
How about @112719 ?  We loved that one.
I really liked that. Surprised myself
Another great suspense would be @151110 .

Definitely!  Thank you!
You have a great day!

Hi.  If you're a horror fan @120092 and @205430 are highly recommended
I do love horror movies
If you're a war fan I liked @199385 and @79698
I really liked @205430
Have you see @206080 I preferred the book but . . .
The only war movie I've ever seen was @180728
Do you know any war movies like that?
@180728 was an awesome film.  You haven't seen @162022 ?
No, I haven't
Was Bradley Cooper in that?
How about zombie stuff?  @89668
Don;t know about Bradley Cooper I don't focus much on the actors' names
@89668 was a really interesting movie
I liked how matter-of-fact it all felt
What's your all-time favorite movie?
I'd like to watch that

What's your all time favorite?
Oh, Jeff Bridges is great

It's worth a watch but it's kind of bloody
I'm going to check out @162022
A little blood goes a long way with me.
You may find you like it!  @199385 is, I think, better.  Gonna go watch movies now, bye
Bye

Did you see @90950
Oh, yes, but nó có been so long.  I would like seeing that again!
Love those blue people.
An older movie is @117515 I found it be a little dark

I'll look it up.
Thank you for the suggestions!
You are appreciated.
you're welcome. have a great weekend.
You, too.  Goodbye.
Hi. Plans this weekend?
Good afternoon!  I'm in the mood to sit in the cool air conditioning and watch a good ghost story.
Something like, well, @182814 , for example.
Ha ha. There's @104248
But, not silly like @136983 .  Like it, not in the mood for it.
Oh, I've not seen @104248 .
I'll have to look it up.  Is it scary hoặc funny?
A little of both. Did you see @187879
Yes, that is one of my favorites!
And, I haven't seen it in ages.
Those are great suggestions.  I appreciate them!
A more recent one is @184418  It's not a ghost story but has a bit of a horror vibe
I liked @184418 , but nó cón't been that long since we watched it.  Good suggestion otherwise.
Well have fun binging!
I'm going to look up @104248 for sure.  Thank you!
Goodbye.

I'm torn between going to see @205375  and staying in to watch @79408
have fun
Thanks. You too
Hi how are you !

Good.  Tell me your three favorite movies so I can make good recommendations
I really like @101264 @186352 and @142069
Have you seen @191297 @202190 and @107826 ?
I only seen @107826 !!! Hilarious movie omg
And @170722
I liked meet the parents too.  How about @134064 ?
Hmm never seen it I will have to add it to my list
You might like it nếu bạn thíchd @170722 and you might like @174755 as well

Omggg I wanna watch g again !!!
Another FAN!!! YES!  Time to go watch a movie!  Nice chatting with you!
It*
Yess lol you tooo bye :)
Hello
heloo how are you?
Not bad.
I love thriller movies. Do you know any good ones such as @146640
I haven't seen that one but I love @126916
Oh wow I have not seen that one.
Do you know any other ones?
Red eye sounds very intriguing .
One of my favorites is @203424
I love anthony hopkins
Of course , that is a classic. Amazing movie , can rewatch it at any time
My favorite genre is horror, do you have any suggestions for me?
I just saw @205430 a couple days ago. Its more monster horror but it was still a nice movie to watch
Sadly , I am not a huge fan of horror so I can't really help you there
I saw that, I thought it was an excellent use of silence in a horror film, especially for a first time director
Yea and it was a great thing that they casted an actual deaf girl to play the role . Makes the movie feel more real after learning that
Yes, representation is important
Have you seen any good comedies lately?
No I have not , have you . I been meaning to watch some.
@204870 was hilarious, I would definitely recommend it
Oh of course that was a great movie , I personally preferred the first one tho
One of my favorites overall is @184605 . I also really enjoy mel brooks movies like @168892
Oh thank you for the recomendations . I usually dont watch movies from the 70's but i might check it out in the future.
they are definitely worth your time
Well anyway , Thanks for the good conversation. Goodbye.
Hello!
Hi how are you?!
Doing fine, and you?
Good thanks for asking what kind of movies do you like ?
I tend to like things that are visually distinctive with multiple layers to work with.  I lean towards animation most of the time because of its expressiveness.  A good example would be the bleakness of @136013, an animated documentary that just throws away objectivity and tries to recreate a war moment through the eyes of its participants.
What do you tend to like in films?
Hmm that’s pretty cool I will have to check that out and pay attention to it !
I like comedy and action especially @101264
Have you seen any of the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy ( @182960, @127115, @77666 )?  They're delightful combinations of genre satire and genre tributes with tight cinematography and a delightful wit, directed by the person behind @195979 .
They're quite British, but are otherwise extremely distinct and, despite not being connected in terms of story, feel like a cohesive series.
(they also have running gags throughout, some of which are things brought up very early in the films and come back as a punchline you'd almost forget)
I haven’t but I will add them to my list for sure !
Any other films you like in particular?
I usually watch American films
In that case, I can just recommend the aforementioned @195979, a fun and tightly-choreographed action film packed with wit, a heist film where almost everything is in sync with the music.
Is it on Netflix ?!
I'm not sure, but I can check
not at this point, unfortunately
Ahhh dang no worries I’m sure I will be able to find it somewhere even the video store !
To top things off (and fulfill my requirements), there's an anime film from a highly-regarded director that inspired many elements of @101264, @78453 by Satoshi Kon.  It's not to everyone's taste, but it might be worth a go if you want that kind of surreal head trip.
Unfortunately, I'm running low on time, so I'll have to stop there.  I hope that at least some of these are appealing and that you find at least one enjoyable.
Have a good evening.
No problem I really appreciate your thoughts burn :)
hello!
Hello
I love action movies
Do you know any good ones?
Me too!
I am a big fan of @161313
WOW that is also one of my most favorite action movies
It's a classic
My favorite is probably @139878
That is also a solid choice!
The best of the terminator films
Oh yea for sure easily
Do you watch any international action films?
Yes Korean action movies are my favorite
Such as @199262  and @189020
have you seen @115675
I love both of those!!
No that is the one action movie from Korea that I have not seen surprisingly
I just could not find a good quality version of that movie
It used to be on netflix
Dang I would have checked it out for sure. I have heard great things about that
Have you seen @170768
Another solid korean action movie
@186421  is also excellent
No I'll look into that for sure
Yea but I felt that movie was too melodramatic but I still enjoyed it a lot
The ending really got me
Yea I saw it coming but it was still sad to see
Hated the businessman so much in that movie
Yeah I was just waiting for him to die, he lived longer than I thought he would
Well do you know any good thrillers ?
Like @112719
@182709 is one of my favorites
Yea it is one of my favorites too. David Fincher just knows how to make really nice movies
You should watch @158571  if you have not seen it yet
Oh I did watch the original, not the american remake
I have really enjoyed this conversation, I'm glad we got matched up
Same. thanks for the conversation.
Goodbye.
Goodbye

Hello!  What kind of movie are you in the mood for?
If you aren't sure, I can make general suggestion.  For example, I would recommend seeing @205375 .
It is a very smart movie with great actresses.
hey sorry

That's okay.
I'm good, how about you?
Im good
Are you in the mood for something particular?
looking for a movie with some adventure
something like @180899
hoặc @106233
Both of those are great!
I would recommend going to see @178258 .  My friend told me it was worth the price of a ticket.
And, nếu bạn thích @106233 , did you ever see the most recent @83552 ?  It was funny.  Definitely a different concept.
I haven't seen it but I heard it was awesome!
I haven't seen the new one but I do love The Rock.
Me, too!
I will definitely check both of those out.
Great!
Thanks for the recommendations!
I hope you have fun watching some movies!
Goodbye!
Good morning!
hi

Are you looking for a movie to watch today?

Cool.  What kind of movie would you like to see?
I'm looking for something fun like @191071
hoặc @130420
That is an oldie but goody!
yes. I grew up in the 80s and love those type of movies.
I was actually about to say @130420 . Haha.
lol
You would probably like @140498 .
Tom Cruise doing Bob Segar in his underwear.  Doesn't get much better than that.
haven't seen that one in forever
it is a great movie
And, you would like @107677 , of course.  nó có John Cusak.
Oh yeah! Great movie.
I mean, John Cusack.
I am going to check out both of those!
thanks!
Yes.  It might not be an 80's movie, but it's good.
You're welcome!  Have fun watching some movies!
You are right
thanks again.
goodbye
Goodbye!
Hello!
Hello!
How are you
What kind of movies do you like
I'm great, thanks for asking!  I'm in the mood for a great 80's horror film.  My favorite horror film of all time is probably @90552 .
If you want to suggest something not from the 80's, that's okay, too.  If you can think of something similar to that era, it's good.
@77161 is super good !
Yes!  We loved that movie.  It was scary back then, campy now.
I've seen that recently.  Can you think of another?  We also loved @143062 .
Hahha exactly ! Still gives me shivers lol
Have you seen @127019 ?!
Freddy was definitely one to give shivers.  I think I slept with my light on after seeing it.
Oh, yes!  That's the one with Jeff Goldblum, I think?
I haven’t seen it in a while but from what I could remeber it was ok lol
Yes you’re right !!
I haven't seen that in ages.  It would be a fun one to see.  Thank you for reminding me about it!
You are awesome and much appreciated!
No problem it would be perfect for a movie night :)
Goodbye!
Awe you are too nice chatting :) bye!
Hi!
Good morning!
How are you doing today ?!
I'm doing great!  I hope you are, too.
I am thank you :) what type of movies do
You enjoy watching
I was thinking of putting on a classic movie. We love anything, really.  I was thinking of something along the lines of @175969 .
It was a thrilling action movie.  Hitchcock never disappoints.
Don’t think I’ve seen it is it an action movie ?! One of my favorite classic movie is @84798 im a julia roberts fan
Have you seen @158903 ?!
I remember that one.  I remember seeing it when it came out and being in love with it.  I had the soundtrack on a cassette and played it in my car.
I don't believe I've seen @158903  yet.  You liked it?
Awee really ! Yes it was excellent very nostalgic
Yes I like it a lot it’s with Dwayne Johnson! I’ve seen greater action but I enjoyed it
@101264 is another good one
Oh, I love The Rock.  :)
You should definately watch it then :)!!
I haven't see @101264 , either.  I'm going to look up those movies today!
Thank you for the suggestions!  These sound great.
Yes! It’s with Leonardo DiCaprio
He is great!
No problem !! It was great chatting with you !
You, too!  Goodbye!
Bye!
Hi there
Hello!
How are you ?
I'm good, and I Hope you are as well!  I'm  in the mood for a silly comedy.  Something along the lines of @95533 , perhaps?
Okay great !
I love comedies ! Have you seen @157878
We love crazy movies.  @151656  is another one we like but we saw that recently.

@161313 is a classic
I also liked @182697 .
@112069 was pretty decent

Good morning!
Hi
What kind of movies are you into?
I like @187028
its a cool horror movie I think they did well on the remake
Oh, I never saw that, but I love horror and have some suggestions!
There is one that I saw on Netflix one weekend that I don't think people realize is really good with a cool concept.  @110419
A murderer who can bring his victims back to life.  You'd just have to see it.  It's cool.
Also, one of my all-time favorite horror movies is @180224 .  That has a sci-fi feel, too.
I haven't seen it, but I think I saw a similiar movie with that premise @204334
I haven't seen that one but keep meaning to see it.
You have good taste in movies obviously!
Thanks you too
I hope I've been helpful to you?
Yes very thanks!
Great!  Have fun watching some flicks.  Goodbye!
Hi! What kind of movies do you like?
I like horror movies. My favorites are @182858 and @202190
Have you seen @88751?
I love @88751
How about @187879
I actually haven't seen that one! Nhưng I know it's a classic.
It's good. The camera work can make people nauseous, though.
Yeah, I heard that
and, of course, there are classics like @76012. Have you seen that?
and @195148?
Yeah, the old ones are great. I love @76012  and @148114 .
My boyfriend won't watch horror movies with me, only comedies. Can you recommend a comedy?
Try @78186 !
Ha
Good idea!
Thanks, I'm gonna try that one
have a great day!
you too~
Hi, how are you today?
Hi. I'm good. How are you?
I'm good. What kind of movies are you looking for?
I like family movies like @204651
Do you like older Disney films like @76620? hoặc @163184?
I've seen those. They are pretty good!
Or for something newer, you might like @77293.
I haven't seen that yet, but I have read the book and I really liked it. I'll have to watch the movie.
Yeah, I loved that book when I was a kid! I hope they make movies of the sequels.
That would be great!
Thank you for the suggestions!
Another newer family film is @205744. Have you seen that yet?
No, I haven't seen that one.
Hope this helps you find what you're looking for.
It helps a lot. Thank you!
Have a great day! Bye
Hello. How are you today?
I'm good. How are you?
Great!
What kind of movies do you like?
Can you recommend any good family movies that tweens might like?
A great one is @106388. Have you seen that? Also, @104378 is good too.
Those sound good. I don't think the kids have seen them yet.
They're nieces, not my kids. So it's not like I am a bad mom who doesn't know which movies her kids have seen. :)
Have you seen @190018 hoặc @188683? Those are both great!
I saw the original @195424 with Ralph Macchio, but not the new one. Haven't seen Wimpy kid. Nhưng they're good suggestions.
Another good idea is @84854. This is the live action, not a cartoon so they might like it.
I think they saw that one already. Nhưng maybe they might want to see it again.
Thanks for you help!
I hope I gave you some good ideas
Have a great day!
hi there
how are you?
Well. How are you?
Great
what type of movie are you looking for?
Something scary.
Do you have any recommendations?
have you seen @153346 ?
hoặc @160661 ?
No I haven't seen @153346. What is it about?
Its a scary movie about demons
google the name and enjoy the trailer
I'm not into demons. Any ideas that have real-life villains?
@169012 ?
It looks like Saw!
huh?
It looks like @115463.
No, nothing like @115463
Well I only viewed the first 360 seconds of the trailer so far.
Its about a guy who can not be hurt. Kinda like a superhero. He goes after real life bad guys. The villian of the movie is the opposite....his bones are like glass.
Thanks.
anyways, i hope you liked my suggestions.
Nhưng it does seem to be a movie that messes with your mind.
Have a great day! Goodbye.
Hello.
Do you know any good horror movies?
Yes rings
What is @157997 about?
It is horror movie where the little girl fears all as a ghost coming out of the well.
I think I've seen part of it.
Oh nice why don't you see the full movie
Maybe if it comes on TV.
Yes it may come in festival occasions otherwise you may see in amazon prime videos.
Thanks. Bạn đã xem phim này chưa @184951. That's the kind of horror movie I like.
Though I didn't really like @83057.

Scremy?
Scary?
it very much fears me, yes scary.
What other movie scares you?
The conjuring.

Yes the movie fears you very much, keep your mind strong enough.
Thanks for the suggestion. Goodbye. Have a great day.
Thank you very much dude.

Dramas like @188656?
I've never seen that, but I like movies like @193166 and @101264
Oh. I've never seen those.
What about @196460?
Haven't seen that either, sorry.
Inception is by Christopher Nolan. Have you seen any other Christopher Nolan movies, like @134106 hoặc @111540

My favorite @101158 movie is the second one.

Yes. You should. And while you're watching movies from the 90s, see @157991.
That one I have seen! Although I didn't like it. Did you see @118663
Yes. I didn't like it. I liked the first one though.
Well, thanks for the recommendations. It was fun talking to you!

Goldie Hawn. She's was the thing back in the days, right?

She was hilarious in @203660.
Sorry I haven't seen the new one though.

Hi. Having a good weekend?
Great so far.  I need something unusual to watch that will hold my attention.  I liked @199930
Never heard of that but @120092 was kind of other worldly
@169644 is a dark comedy
And @92911 Ann Hathaway is an alcoholic and wreaks havoc at her sister's wedding
Yep,  that's what I'm looking for and I haven't seen that @120092 yet. I hear @205430 is good too!  I haven't seen @169644 but I'll put it on my list
Hope you enjoy them. Have a great night
Haven't seen @92911 but on the list it goes.  I like robot films too, like @99660
Have a good weekend.
Hi. Can you recommend something to watch tonight?
It's been a long week I'd love to binge on romantic comedies
nếu bạn thích Sci-Fi how about @99660 hoặc @193213 ?
Romantic comedy, how about @132728 hoặc @178711
Haven't seen either. I did see @178927
Tom Hanks is awesome.
I loved @178927 and @147934 you could @134064 for your romantic comedy!!
That's a good idea. I always wanted to see that.
Thanks so much. ((leaving to pop popcorn)) Have a great night
@134064 was fun and touching.
You too!

Yo. What do you want to watch this weekend?
Something suspenseful like @181546
@205557 got good reviews.  @169085 was good too
I wanted to see Red Sparrow. It looks good. Did you see @183582
Nope haven't seen @183582   I like @199930 there's a real twist in it
Haven't heard of that one. I'll have to check it out. Any other ideas?
Did you see @106588 hoặc @193213 they're twisty too
No, haven't seen either. these are some great ideas. Thanks so much
you're welcome!  Do you enough to get you through the weekend?
Think so. If not, I know where to find you. :-)
Have fun!!!
Thanks. Good night.
Hi. I want to veg out this weekend. Know anything that's not too heavy?
How about @138767 hoặc @99660
Never heard of Chappie. I Robot is a little to technical for me
I could watch @194253  every time it comes on TV though
How about @162794 that was fun
Woody Harrelson, right? I loved him in @134885
@169085 was good and is exciting enough to keep you awake
I'm writing all this down and will check Netflix for these.
Thanks so much. Nice chatting with you.
OK then also try @92882 and have a good weekend
Hi what kind of movies do you like?  I like war movies @199385 is a favorite of mine
Tomorrow night are the Tony Awards. I want to watch some musicals that were turned into movies like @106887
@204651 was a musical from this past year.
I LOVED that. I would pay to see it again. Nhưng Hugh Jackman is a god, so. there's that.
By the way I don't know why my responses are doubling
@179035 is old, but there was a similar movie but the name escapes me right now
I didn't know Glee was a movie. Do you remember @149101
I mean @195261
@146224 was a favorite of mine as was @166603
I do remember @195261 wasn't @187205 about the same time?
Yeah it was 80s. I forgot that was turned into a play too
Thanks for the suggestions. Time to get to work. And by work I mean binging!
There was @80240 from that time too!
Have a good weekend
Hello.
Good night
Know any good movies?
Off the top of my head the movie @157924 comes to mind. Only because alot of lines from it are stuck in my head
If you dont like animated stuff I rewatched @148904 recently have you seen it?
No I haven't.
Know something a little more mature but not so crude with humor?
I'm okay with animated though.
I saw @141578 for the first time last week, it wasn't half bad
It took you 23 years to see it?
0_0 never was a fan of action movies. Didn;t think I HAD to watch it lol
You didn't HAVE to do so. I'm joking.
There are probably many classics that I've never seen but I'll check em out eventually. Nhưng this is not about me.
Whats one of your favs?
Seen @179081. @141578 sounds similar.
:)
Ok cool
I like @182318, @193168, and @169288 just to name a few.
Awesome. Hope you choose one of these to enjoy. I might check out a few of them myself
I'm feeling childish, so I think I will check out @157924.
There's not too many fart jokes in it, is it?
Eddie Murphy better be worth it.
Like one fart joke but it's more than just the frat boy humor and @122326  is awesome as well
Hope you like it
Okay. I hope I do as well. Thanks.
Bye.
Bye
Hello
What kind of movies do you like?
I don't particularly care for animation, but I did like @204863
Do you like thrillers?
Yes, I like @106588
Have you seen anything from this century like @112719  and @158571
Yes, I believe @204863 is from this century!
I meant for thrillers not animation
No, I didn't see @112719 though the book was good and I didn't see @158571 though that book was good too!  I did like @205557 somewhat
Huh thats interesting because I only heard negative things about red sparrow
No accounting for taste!
Did you see @204904
yea i did. I love daniel day lewis and his movies but that was not something that I enjoyed
it was a very well made movie for whats its worth
It was depressing.  Did you like @149720
Yes , it is my favorite movie by russel crowe. I like it even more than @171202 which was awesome too
@171202 was wonderful!
I;m going to go watch a movie now,  Bye
Well goodbye.
Hello
What kind of movies do you like?
Hi night
Don't really have a favorite type
Just watch whatever is interesting
Hmm. What is the most recent movie you saw that you liked then
off the top of your head
I saw @204870
Of course , that was a great movie. Very entertaining
You should check out @169487
nếu bạn thích comedy movies
Thanks I'll check it out
I guess I sorta like superhero films no matter how tacky they are. @205163 was good too
That makes sense.
Have you seen @198707
by any chance
Its not a traditional super-hero movie but its still considered one and its great
I loved that movie. I do think I liked it because of the approach it took to the superhero thing as well
Its been a while since I've seen it I might just rewatch it tonight
How about @168664 . Zach Synder might not have done well with the new dc movies but I loved that movie
have you seen it/
I have heard of it but never got around to watching it
Think I just might
Its phenemonal especially if you see the directors cut
I highly recommend that version of the moive
Well that sounds splendid. Will do
Thanks for these
No problem.
Goodbye.
hi
hi
how are you?
im fine
what is your favorite kind of movies to watch?
i love action movies
I just finished watching @107047
and @78340
can you recommend something good?
sorry the light bulb in my bathroom blew out so I went to change it
ok
I am sure you have seen @144347
yes
loved it
Yeah that's kind a staple action flick
How about @148904
definitely
John wick was great also
I think I might watch it again....now
Sounds like a plan
thanks for the suggestion.
you're welcome
bye
have a good night. goodbye
Hey. How are you?
Hi. I am good, thanks for asking. What about you?
Good, as well.
Can I recommend you something? What kind of movies do you like?
I like comedies and horror.
I love comedies, @135571 is my favorite. Have you seen it?
I am not a big fan of horror movies, I can't sleep at night after. The only movie I really liked is @88751
No, I haven't. And that might be too crude for me. Nhưng then again I haven't seen it.
I like being a little scared. I've seen parts of @88751.
I see. Maybe you should watch @93013
@93013 is a good family comedy, there is also a second part @204478
I actually wanted to see that. Though I've heard @204478 took a turn for the worse.
As for the horror movies, I also liked @80131 . Very scary movie )
Honestly I only watched @93013 . I liked it . I was planning to watch @204478 tomorrow. Hopefully I won't be disappointed like you said
Hopefully not.
I like the recommendation fhoặc @93013.
Let me know if you enjoyed watching it next time )
Okay, if there is a next time!
Hopefully , have a good day )
Good day to you, too!
Hello!
Hello my friend. How are you today?
Well. What about you?
I am good as well, thanks . How can I help you today?
Looking for a movie to watch with my boyfriend. I want to make him uncomortable.
*uncomfortable
lol i see. How about @79935 ? Have you watched it? I think he might be pretty uncomfortable
There is also 2 more parts @192020 and @176326
Yes, I've seen it. I haven't seen the other two though.
It's not the best movie, but it was okay.
I actually liked @79935 . I watched @192020 with my husband and he was uncomfortable.
That's funny.
I agree with you @79935 is defiantly not worth watching again
Why in particular was he uncomfortable?
What about @169487 . Maybe this will work
In other hands @169487 was making me more uncomfortable, not my husband
@79935 is basically a movie for girls. He didn't like it and he said it was dumb . lol
Have you seen @152847 hoặc @106588?
I saw @152847 . I liked it. I haven't seen @106588 . bạn có thích nó không? Is it worth watching?
If you're in the mood for revenge, Shakespeare style.
Google says that @112719 might be uncomfortable to watch together. Bit I don;t know why. I loved @112719
@112719 is exactly about the revenge! Maybe you should go with this one
Maybe because she fakes her own death, right?
Is there a bit of mystery hoặc suspense in @112719?
Yes by I can't say it's uncomfortable. Not to me I Guess )
There is for sure a lot of mystery in @112719
Alright I like that idea. I'm going with @112719!
I hope you'll enjoy! Have a good day !
Thanks! Bye.
Hello
I like crime movies
Me too!
can you recommend me some
Have you seen @97683 ?
It's an older one, but it's really great
Christopher Walken stars in it
i really liked @124848
I loved that movie!
Yes i have seen that one its great
I like Walken also
The Coen Brothers do crime movies really well
Like @140536 , their first movie
Have you seen it?
I havent seen it
You should!  It's excellent
And, ,like @124848 , it is set in Texas
I think i will, bạn nên xem @182709 if you havent

THanks!
Bye!
Bye!
Hi there!  What kind of movies do you like?
hI I am looking for something different. Usually I like war movies like @199385
I loved @199385 !
What about @96465
?
It's a classic
Really great cast
Never sawy @96465 but I will check it out
Another oldie but goodie is @147047
Have you seen @107554 ?
I like sci-fi too.  @193213 and @199930 were favorites
That's a different take on war movies
@193213 was terrific
I liked @104052 and @147047 also @156082
Have you seen @120092
Yes!  I loved it!
Have you seen @117515 ?  Same director
It's a war movie too
actually
No, not @117515  yet.  I have it on my list
Thanks for the suggestions.  Have a great day!
Excellent!  Time to watch some movies!
Hello!  What kind of movie are you in the mood to see today?
I can make some general recommendations if you aren't sure.  I watched @204974  last night for the first time.  It was pretty good.
hey
Hello!
I haven't seen that yet but I do love comic book movies!
I just watched @169419 last week
Oh, nice.  I bet that was good.  How about @99583 ?  It is one of my favorites out of the super hero genre.
yeah, that was a great one.
Of course, my all-time favorite super hero movie is @108195 .  Can't beat the original.  I love Christopher Reeves.
Not a big superman fan.
If you want to see something with a comedic slant, you could find @194891 .  It was funny.
hahaha I love that you suggested that. Such a fun movie.
Yes, it was.  I saw that when it was released.  I'm telling my age now.
I think I have some great suggestions. Going to go watch @204974 now.
I hope I've helped!
you did
have a good one. Goodbye.
Have fun watching movies!  Goodbye.
Do you like smart comedy?  If so you might like @134064
I liked that one. Since the Tony Awards are tonight, I thought it would be fun to talk about musicals.
@204651 was well regarded.  I've not seen it myself
I've been wanting to see that one.
Do you like the oldies like @166603
There's also @146224 with Gene Kelly
Yes, I like the old ones. South Pacific was great. So was Singing in the Rain. Of course, my all-time favorite is @93497.
Oh, yes @93497  and don't forget @187102
Anything with Julie Andrews! :)
Too bad about what happened to her voice!
I know. I'm glad she's still getting work doing voice overs for animated films, but it isn't the same as hearing her sing.
No, it's not!  Well, I thiink I'm going to go watch a movie.  Bye
Bye, and thanks for chatting!
Hello!
Hi the Tony's are tonight have you seen @204651
I'm looking for a movie to watch with monsters.  For example, I loved @127357 .
I have seen @204651 .  It was great!  Loved the music.
I saw that recently, though, so I'm looking for something different.
@136000 has monsters!
Yes, very cute monster.  I like that one.
I also liked @180224 .  It probably has more monsters than any other movie.
@138767 wasn't really about monsters, but it was good
I haven't heard of that.  What is it about?
I haven't seen @180224 .  @138767 was about a robot.  I'm into robots!  I loved @193213 and @99660
I'd probably like @138767 , then.  Love sci-fi, loved the other movies you mentioned.
Thank you for the suggestions!  I'm going to look up @138767  for sure.
Good.  Happy watching. bye
Goodbye!
Good afternoon.
Hi there.  Tony's tonight.  Did you see @204651
Yes, I've seen that one recently.  I really liked it, but looking for something else.
How about another musical?  Maybe something like @104180
Something musical like @77306 might be good
That's an oldie but goodie!
Hmmm.  I don't think I saw the one from 1979.  That might be good to look up.  I saw @117942
@137927 ?
Wow, I LOVE @137927 , both the movie and the show.  I also really enjoyed @124268
@187205 ?
That's also a good one.  I think I'm going to check out this Oklahoma from 1979, @77306 .
I'm curious about it now.
Thank you for the suggestions.
You're welcome.  Enjoy.  Bye for now
Goodbye!

Hi!
Hi. How are you?
What kind of movies do you like?
Can you recommend a movie for me that has British actors hoặc is set in Britain?  An example of this would be @186271 .
I'm doing okay, thanks.  I hope you are, too.
I also really enjoyed @107477 .  It was a hoot.
Thank you . I am . I haven't seen @107477  hoặc @186271 . Nhưng let me think a little , because I am not really good with British actors )
That's fine.
I love Benedict Cumberbatch. Have you watched @104989 ? I heard it's really good
Yes, Benedict is great!  I saw it but it seems as if it's been a few years.  It would be good to see again.
Of course, the @76940 movies are always nice to see again.  My son really enjoys them.
I think you will enjoy @104989 . I will also recommend you @142573
Yes, that is a great movie as well.  Thank you for the suggestions!
I appreciate it!
That's right! I completely forgot about the @76940 . I loved also @106853 . First one is classic
Yes, it is.
I didn't like @159991 though. What about you?
I'm not sure out of which of @76940 hoặc @161638  is my favorite. I liked them both.
I enjoyed @159991 .  It was a sad ending.
I agree with you @161638 is also very good. Maybe that's why I didn't like @159991
You are awesome!  Thank you for the chat!
Thank you ! Have a good day !
You have a great afternoon.  Goodbye!

How did you like @100723 ?
it wasn't bad, had some funny moments
I assume you watched @136983 and @120293 ? I mean it's classic !
Yes, the classics were so damn good.
I would recommend you @185051

I would also recommend you @114453 . It's very funny! About a mum and a daughter who brake men's heart to get money from them
I have seen that one.

@193762 was really funny
Yes, I've watched @148120 . I liked it .
I haven't seen @193762 . What this movie about ?
Its about a couple teachers
Can I watch @193762 with kids?
the teachers end up mad at each other.
It depends how old the kids are.
8 years old
Yeah, probably too young
@193762 t sounds really fun ! Can you recommend something else? I would like to have more options
for family friendly have you seen @182731
Or maybe something I can watch with a kid
@182731 is awesome ! My kid absolutely loved it.
Her favorite movie is @133249 . Maybe you've seen this one

Alright, well I hope my suggestions were good for you.
Have a great one. Goodbye.
Thank you for you recommendations ! I
Bye
Hey there, can I recommend a movie for you? I love fantasy movies, like @187310
Hi, sorry yes!
: )
Well, I actually am not a fan of that whole trilogy but I know it was a good film.
What sort of movies do you like?
I love a good comedy hoặc animated movie like @97413
Awww. I love animated movies, too.
I'm excited fhoặc @205724
Can't wait it comes out June 15th I believe.
I also just fell in love with @122604
Such a sweet movie. ♥
I saw @97413 and really liked it.
I'm not sure that I've seen @159885
I'm also a big @91547 fan can't wait fhoặc @206076
So I'm not sure if I would want to see the second one, but I loved @122604 !
Oh you must see it!
Incredibles one is such a cute movie about a superhero family.
@91547 ! That one's good, too.
Mhm, many good sequels this year!  I'm quite excited for it too!
Well, thanks for the chat my friend.
Excellent, thank you!
Hello, how are you today?
Hi, I like horror films like @123210
That wasn't a horror film, aside from all the singing LOL
However how about @176394
@123210 was about a couple stranded on a ski lift overnight
Oh... I thought was that animated musical.
Forgive me, haven't seen hoặc heard of it.
That's the other @82894 the one with the bad singing!
LOL, yes!
I figured you were being funny as it was such painful singing.
How about @204794 there's a new one now @187028
I liked @199930 as well though the horror was subtle
Or what's that one I remember people saying was scary @171056
I never saw @204794 hoặc @187028
Well, sorry I'm not the best of help today lol, but hopefully you will find something to watch with these suggestions.
I haven't seen @171056 was @110046 also horror?
Not sure, I haven't actually seen either lol
Did you see @120092 ?
Nope, never even heard of it.  Is that horror?  I need to catch up on some horror films soon!
bạn có thích nó không?
Yes it was billed as horror and no not yet.
Thanks for your suggestions I will check them out!  Bye
I'll have to check it out.
You're welcome, bye for now.
Hi, I'm looking for a good Western movie to watch with my boyfriend. I enjoyed Westworld, the series.  I didn't particularly like  Do you know of any good ones?
Woops, didn't particluarly like @81898
Well, I only recommend movies!  How about a good war movie @199385 was great!
@199385 was a little violent in my opinion. Nhưng I'd probably watch it again if he wanted to see it.
I did enjoy @104052
How about @181284
I've never seen @181284 . Sounds like a good idea.
There's a western I wanted to watch @160163
I
I've never seen that one. Thank you for the suggestions!
There's another one called @157174
Thank you for the chat. I look forward to watching some new movies soon!
Have a good weekend
Hi, I'm looking for a good Adventure movie to watch with my boyfriend.  I liked @98433    Do you know of any good ones?
How about a horror movie @123210
Lol, I see what you did there. I've seen that one, and thought it was cute. lol
No, that's the other @82894 you're thinking about.  My @123210 is about a couple stuck on a ski lift.  One is eaten by a wolf!  Honest
Oh...
I did not see the horror one.
It made quite an impression on me!
That sounds really good, though. I like Thrillers.
Will definitely give it a hot.
shot
What thriller is your favorite
Hmmm, probably @101264
I enjoyed that one.
Do you have a fave Thriller movie?
@101264 was GOOD!  I enjoyed @96140 though that vears toward horror as well
I need to watch @96140 then. Thank you for the chat!
I liked @94056
Have a great weekend!
You too. : )
Hi, I'm looking for a good SciFi movie.  I liked @79062  because of its really good use of camera angles and special effects. Back in the day they didn't use computer graphics. Do you know of any good ones?
Did you like @151728
I saw that one, but I didn't like it, because it was so sad and deeply disturbing violence.
How about @86414
Erm, I saw that one too. Way too freaky for me. I thought it was distrubing too.
Yes, they both were disturbing!  Would you prefer a comedy romance like @134064
Horror is a little bit different than Scifi. I liked  @147934
Oh, have you seen @170376
I haven't! I know what I'm going to watch soon. Thank you for the suggestions.
have a good weekend
You too!
Hi, I'm looking for a good old school Disney animated movie.  I enjoyed @78062  . Do you know of any good ones?
How about @82894 and/hoặc @204863
I saw @82894 , but have not yet seen @204863 . It looks good, though.
@204863 was TERRIFIC!  nếu bạn thích old school there is always @123995 and @99966
I might ultimately watch @163708 , but I've seen both @123995 and @100382
I've also seen the older version of @119247
@97413 isn't disney but is still very good
Thank you for the chat! I really appreciate the suggestions.
Have a good weekend
Hello!  What kind of movies are you into?
Hi!  I'm into horror at the moment like @86414
That's a great one.  I remember seeing that when I was a teenager.
How about another old one like @83586 ?
The original was the best in my opinion.
I also liked @148114 and @123210
Yes, those are great.
Oh, yeah, the @83586
How about @170540 if you are a @148114  fan?
I have just seen @182858 which is pretty good
It's about a mutated baby.  I remember it scared me when I was a kid but haven't seen it in years.
That is a great movie.
You have good taste!
I haven't see @170540 but that goes on my list
Thanks for the suggestions!
I hope you have fun watching some movies!
Goodbye!
bye
Hello!
Hi what kind of movies do you like?  I just saw @182858
I'm in the mood for a movie with a good love story.  But, not @169159 .  Something a little bit more upbeat.
@182858  was good, but I'm in the mood for something different.
How about @197918 hoặc @132728
A good love story that is upbeat is @77707 .
I loved @77707 !  How about @138767
Oh, yes.  I love @197918 and haven't seen it in ages.  I am so in love with Meg Ryan in @132728 , too.
I've never seen @138767  but heard of it.  I'll have to check it out.  Thank you!
@75918 was fun
Yes, that was my senior year in High School, so it was a popular movie then for sure.
Thank you for the suggestions!  I appreciate it!
You're welcome.  Have fun watching!
Goodbye!

So like action ?!
yes, but based on a true story like @135142
Gotcha ! @76042 was really good ! Have you seen it
hoặc @122208
No, what was @76042 ow about
A married couple happily together but everything shifted when the wife got in a car accident and wasn’t in a Coma for a long time, after she wasn’t out of coma she was not the same
@122208 ld was not about climbing.  I mean like @141770
Have you seen @85298
Nope, @76042 was not about the kind of climbing I'm referring to like @102067
hoặc @204456 ?! Those are climbing movies

Hi.
@169419
I don't like superhero movies.
Neither do I usually, but this film has some humor to it.
Can you recommend something purely comical?
The actions scenes are a majority of the movie, but nó có nice graphics.
Do you like mythology?
I would rate this movie an 8 out of 10.
Nope, not enough to seek it. I like to be scared and to laugh at movies.
@111918 is a seriously hilarious.
it is extremely funny!
I seen part of @111918. It seemed like an alright movie.
Will Ferrell and Mark Walburgh really compliment each other.
I laughed out loud throughout the whole movie.
I don't think you will regret watching it all the way through.
You really like the movies you suggest.
Any other Will Ferrell movies you can suggest?
Yes, otherwise I would be wasting your time.
True.
@142910 is also worth checking out.
That is actually the movie with Mark.
What's that about?
It is about two cops.  Will's character used to be a pimp.
Many good laughs to be had.
I hope you check them out.
@124142 is good for Christmas time, but it is a bit corny.
The new @83552 is way better than I thought.
I'm not interested in @142910. Nhưng have you seen @141928?
Jack Black and the Rock play the roles of the avatars in the game.
It seemed funny from the previews years back.
There is a new one that came out last year.
It is much more funny than the original.
I was still referring to @141928 by the way.
@141928 was alright.
@133813  is another classic he is in.
You're not as enthusiastic about @141928, are you?
I just don't like the Nascar theme much.
I am familiar @133813. It looks like it can be good.
I will go with @133813. Thanks.
That sounds great enjoy it with friends.
I will.
Have a good day/night!
You also!

And interesing thing about @202190 is that the actress was actually pushed too hard by the producer and ended up displaying a lot of her true feelings on set. They kept all of the footage.

Thanks for the recommendations, we'll talk later
see you later bye
bye...
Hello. How are you?
Hi how about a good comedy like @107826
Nope. I like scary movies, ones when you don't know who the killer is.
I was thinking something like @184951.
OK.  @106588 was good, but I think we knew who the killer was
Yes, I did.
Didn't see @184951 - I'm thinking!
And I wouldn't call that horror unless you're thinking old school horror.
How about @77115
Who is this Jack guy you speak of?
Oh, horror.  How about @123210 ?
@77115 is a book character they turned into a movie character.  He's quite intersting.
Does he happen to be a detective?
I liked @199930 for horror.  Nhưng there was a question of anyone getting killed, but you knew the killer.  Yes, Jack Reacher is sort of a detective
I don't think I've ever really watched a mystery.
I just finished @182858
I'm sort of intrigued.
I also liked @86414
Haha. @86414 seems like a throwback to me. Weird kids in that one!
Yes, @86414 is an oldie, but also remade in 2009 @123700 I think the 2009 one has the weird kids
I haven't seen the new one yet.
Me either.  Just the trailers.
So did you like @77115?
Yes, I did like @77115 , I like the books as well though they've gotten very commercial
Too bad on the commercial aspect. Nhưng I've settled on @77115 as my choice.
Good.  Go watch your movie and hopefully we'll chat later.  bye
Thanks. Bye.
Hello.
Hi.  Wanna see a war movie like @199385
Nope. I want to see an animation. I like @182318, but I'm up for suggestions.
OK I really liked @204863 and I don't normally watch animated stuff!
Then go back to your childhood!
What's @204863 about?
Oh, no, I am selective as an adult for example I loved @97413 !  Ferdinand was a peaceful bull who didn't want to fight and of course in Spain all bulls fight
@97413 sounds more interesting than @204863.
Different vibe!  Both are good.  I also liked @154844 and @140823
@182318 was released when I was an adult, of course. I want to see it because it was stop-motion.
I haven't seen @182318 but I loved @85417
I hope I gave you some suggestions you'll enjoy!  Have a great day, bye.
I've never heard of the @85417. I'm guessing it's an indie. And was it inspired by @188224?
That was a joke by the way.
Bye.
How are you doing today?
Hi, I'm up for anything, but I do like climbing movies like @141770
what kind of movie can I recommend for you?
Really just like a GOOD movie!
@85879 is the only climbing movie I know
I like sci-fi @162873

Hi, I like almost anything
Hey. Do you like Eddie Murphy?
He's OK.  I like Bill Murray better
Cause I recommend @191672 for the grownups.
And @158433 for the family.
Oh, I haven't seen cause I recommend life and I saw @158433 a million years ago
I liked @189705
I haven't seen that.
There's another one I like something about a guy 'Bob'
If you're in the mood for a revamp of Bill Murray I suggest @204334 fhoặc @120948.
Oh, I haven't seen either of those, but they sound interesting especially @204334
They probably have few similarities, but you can try.
I didn't much care fhoặc @200089
Remember @120948 is Bill Murray.
Why didn't you like @200089?
I don't know, it was kinda dark in some ways
Movies referring to Catholicism usually are.
I don't know why.
You're right!
Thanks for the suggestions.  I will check them out and you have a good evening!  Bye
Peace to you!

There's less slashing in these.

It's about a little girl who gets adopted by a family of four.
When she comes the family's life turns upside down.
Sounds great!! Do you know another movie like @151728??
They have to figure out who she really is.
Massive slasher films? Perhaps you might like the old @130591 movies hoặc maybe @86414.

Hey what kind of movies do you like?
Hello.
I don't mind what genre you recommend. Nhưng I do like comedies and horror.
Nothing too raunchy hoặc little substance though.
Do you like Stephen King movies? What about @117840 hoặc @194147 ?
those are two of my favorites
I also really like @125431 if you're looking for something more modern
I've seen them both, but they don't  make me shiver. They're okay for what they are.
Well @125431 is recent but it's set in the past. I get your point though.
right. I like the stories of the Warrens. @83586 was creepy, but the book was even better!
Are @117840 and @194147 from Stephen King?
they are
Got any more from him hoặc Wes Kraven?
The original @112792 is a good Wes Craven one.
@187028 was actually really good, too.
I think I'll go with @187028. If you led me wrong I can always laugh at it, hopefully.
lol, I think it may have been better than the original
It is about a clown after all!
